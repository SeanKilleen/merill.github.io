      <description><![CDATA[We need the help of others in order to fulfill our destiny, and guess what? Someone needs our help today, too! Every one of us should be invisible in somebody’s life—being behind the scenes, helping others grow, encouraging and pushing them forward, and calling out their seeds of greatness. <br/> <br/>Without Jonathan, David wouldn’t have been the great king. The prophet Elijah performed many great miracles, but behind the scenes, there was Elisha faithfully caring for his every need. Sometimes we are needed in other people’s lives to help them, to be their arms and feet, to lift up their faith when they can’t go on, and help them walk into greatness. Learn how to live each day helping others. As you make other people shine, God will make sure the right people will be there for you to help you shine and rise higher.]]></description>
