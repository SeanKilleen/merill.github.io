<P>Microsoft Sri Lanka is offering a generous gift (limited number) this Christmas season to all dotnetforum community members on a first come first serve basis.</P>
<P>The only catch being that the exam voucher expires on 31-Dec-2006, so you'll need to be ready to do the exam in super quick time.</P>
<P>The voucher entitles you to take one of the following exams:</P>
<P>- 70-431: TS: Microsoft SQL Server 2005 - Implementation and Maintenance<BR>- 70-536: TS: Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 – Application Development Foundation<BR>- 70-551: UPGRADE: MCAD Skills to MCPD Web Develop by Using the Microsoft .NET Framework<BR>- 70-552: UPGRADE: MCAD Skills to MCPD Windows Developer by Using the Microsoft .NET Framework<BR>- 70-553: UPGRADE: MCSD Microsoft .NET Skills to MCPD Enterprise Application Developer by Using the Microsoft&nbsp; .NET Framework: Part 1<BR>- 70-235: TS: Developing Business Process and Integration Solutions Using Microsoft BizTalk Server 2006</P>
<P>If you are interested please get in touch with Wela (BTW I just found out that he’s our new Developer Evangelist) on 777.281.021.</P>
<P>Another humble request is to not waste this precious resource as you might be depriving someone else a chance if you do get the voucher and not take the exam.</P>
