        Just looked up the MSDN Download site and saw that Exchange 2003 is available. I already
        started downloading it! There was a Standard as well as an Enterprise edition wonder
        what's different, I'm downloading the Enterprise edition just to be safe.

        Exchange 2003 is supposed to play very well with Outlook 2003, I'll need to push Madura
        to set it up this week.
