            Williams</a>] <i><span style='font-style:italic'>Here is an interesting summary of
            the problem encountered by the Spirit probe on Mars. Important test lessons: &ldquo;test
            real-world conditions&rdquo; &ldquo;run long-haul stress tests&rdquo;</span></i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i><span style='; font-style:italic'>&ldquo;SYSTEM BEHAVIOR: Spirit began acting up
            last week, when it stopped sending data and began rebooting its computer, resetting
            it roughly 130 times. At one point, the rover thought it was 2053.</span></i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i><span style='; font-style:italic'>BUG DESCRIPTION: Engineers found that the rover's
            256 megabyte flash memory had retained hundreds of files containing flight data and
            was still juggling them along with the daily flood of new data from its activities
            in Mars' Gusev Crater.</span></i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i><span style='; font-style:italic'>WORKAROUND: By commanding Spirit each morning
            into a mode that avoids using the flash memory, engineers plan to begin deleting hundreds
            of unneeded files to make the memory more manageable for the rover's RAM.</span></i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i><span style='; font-style:italic'>WHY WASN'T THIS CAUGHT IN TEST?: The bug had
            not been detected in operational tests of the rover on Earth because the longest tests
            lasted only eight or nine days.&rdquo;</span></i>
