<p>I had to work really hard preparing for last week&rsquo;s session on the <a href="http://-functional%20specification%20was%20not%20developed%20for%20the%20worksheets/">Enterprise Library</a>. </p>
<p>Since this is a relatively new release, there is scarcely any information available online. The lack of online resource is more than made up for by the clear, well documented help that comes with the installation. The quickstarts are a godsend to get things up and running.</p>
<p>With each block your best bet is to do a quick read of that module on the help and then go through the quick starts, then get your hands dirty writing a small mock app of your own. You can download the presentation that I made from <a href="http://www.merill.net/wp-content/uploads/contentbinary/IntroductionToTheEnterpriseLibrary.ppt">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.vbcity.com/shandy/">Shandy</a>, to answer your question about performance relating to the Logging block, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/lorenh">Loren</a> has <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/lorenh/archive/2005/02/18/376191.aspx">blogged</a> about an impromptu test he carried out comparing <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/">log4net</a> against the Enterprise Library.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://blogs.vbcity.com/shandy">Shandy</a> posts a <a href="http://blogs.vbcity.com/shandy/archive/2005/03/06/1147.aspx">review</a> of my last presentation. </p>
