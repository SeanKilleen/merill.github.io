            Got my Longhorn PDC DVD’s delivered today through DHL. I didn’t expect to receive
            this for two reasons 1. This was free and 2. I’m in Sri Lanka so Microsoft needs to
            spend a lot to ship this to me. But it looks like Microsoft is really determined to
            get everyone hacking out code for Longhorn.

            The pack consisted of two Longhorn <span class="SpellE">dicsc</span> and one for Whidbey.
            Since I don’t have a DVD drive I’ll need to borrow the DVD notebook from Dr. Alles
            and try to setup Longhorn on that. I’ll have about four days of Christmas vacation,
            hope I can play with this stuff during that time.
