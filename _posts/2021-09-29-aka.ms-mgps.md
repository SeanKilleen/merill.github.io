Having trouble finding the Graph PowerShell commandlet reference? I created an easy to remember shortcut at [aka.ms/mgps](https://aka.ms/mgps).

Now you can find the reference for commands like Connect-MgGraph, Get-MgUser quickly.

**BTW Are you migrating your old Azure AD PowerShell scripts to the new Graph PowerShell?**

Did you know that we also have a handy map of the commands at [Find Azure AD and MSOnline cmdlets in Microsoft Graph PowerShell | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/powershell/microsoftgraph/azuread-msoline-cmdlet-map?view=graph-powershell-beta)
