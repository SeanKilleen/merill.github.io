            Guerrilla gardening is the art of using a piece of land which you do not own to grow
            something. One step removed from actual guerrilla warfare, guerrilla gardening takes
            land not for the people, but for nature; returning misused or disused land and finding
            a purpose for it. Guerrilla gardeners come late in the night with watering cans, compost
            and gardening gloves, and turn rotting sods of grass outside some condemned building
            into a vegetable patch, a clump of daffodils, or a flowering rosebush.<br />
