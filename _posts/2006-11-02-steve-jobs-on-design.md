<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of Steve Jobs quotes recently here is another one I can relate to with the products that I&rsquo;m building.</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>&ldquo;Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. That&rsquo;s not what we think design is. It&rsquo;s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.&rdquo; &ndash; Steve Jobs</p></blockquote>
