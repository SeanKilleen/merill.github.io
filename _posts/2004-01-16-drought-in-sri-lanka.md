            Cabinet has given the go-ahead to &lsquo;maximise&rsquo; use of thermal power in the
            short term, as officials warn of a drought and an inevitable capacity shortfall in
            the months ahead.
        </p>

            A delay in the North East monsoon in the largely hydropower dependant country has
            seen reservoir levels fall to an average 31.8 percent as at Wednesday.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cabinet spokesperson Professor G.L. Peiris said Wednesday that a decision had been
            taken to maximise the use of thermal power in the short term, but did not elaborate.

        <p>
            With zero inflows into the reservoirs currently, the system is generating some five
            million units of hydropower a day, as against a demand of about 23 million units,
            Energy sector specialist, Dr. Tilak Siyambalapitiya said.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;We are already in the middle of the drought,&rdquo; warns Siyambalapitya.
        </p>
        <p>
            An unfortunate but predictable lack of adequate thermal generating capacity in the
            system could mean a round of blackouts, if rains continue to fail or emergency power.
