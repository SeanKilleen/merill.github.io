If you Visual Studio 2010 setup keeps failing when it tries to install the  Visual C++ runtime, hereâ€™s a quick fix for you.

Try installing one of the Visual Studio 2010 Express Editions (I did the Web  Edition: <a title="http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx" href="http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx">http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx</a>)  and then run the VS2010 installation.

I think it has something to do with mounting the ISO as a drive.
