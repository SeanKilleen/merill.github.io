NOTE: I have moved this page over to [https://github.com/microsoft/aka](https://github.com/microsoft/aka#readme) to allow other folks to contribute. Please head over there.

Iâ€™m a command line guy and hate having to click to get to various Azure AD pages. 

Overtime I created these shortcuts and thought you might find them helpful.

Here is how it works. Open a new tab and type [aka.ms/ad/{command}](https://aka.ms/ad/list)

Where shortcut is one of the commands below.
