            One of the best keyboard shortcuts for a developer! When in a code window for Visual
            Studio, you can go full screen, hiding all the other windows, toolbars, title bars,
            and even your start bar. This is the same effect that Internet Explorer has when it's
            in "Full Screen" mode.
