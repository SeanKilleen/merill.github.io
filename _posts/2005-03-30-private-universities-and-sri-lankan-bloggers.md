<p>There&rsquo;s been some really heavy discussions happening in the blogosphere about the whole Private University debate for Sri Lanka. <a href="http://indi.ca/">Indi</a> and <a href="http://morquendi.blogspot.com/">Morquendi</a> are the two main contributors, <a href="http://blog.brainwaves.ws/">Kavinda</a> linked to these guys earlier this week and by god, these guys are still going at it today. Read the latest post from Indi titled <a href="http://indi.ca/2005/03/private-universities-sri-lanka/">Private University FAQs</a>. <a href="http://ivap.blogspot.com/">Ivap</a> posts a <a href="http://ivap.blogspot.com/2005/03/and-happy-couple-they-make-not.html">summary of the debate</a> between these guys.</p>
<p>Boy, I for one am excited to see our very own Sri Lankan&rsquo;s actively blogging and slogging things out. There&rsquo;s even a cool <a href="http://kottu.org/">Kottu.org</a> hosting a whole heap of Sri Lankan bloggers. Way to go guys!</p>
