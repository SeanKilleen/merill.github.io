<P>I can't wait to go back and get my hands on the pilot MSDN Hard Drive that Microsoft is testing out. The MVPs are doing pilot tests on a future where the MSDN subscription would be offered in a huge 300GB hard disk and then updates downloaded to it. Forget about all the CDs/DVDs that Microsoft ships out monthly.</P>
<P>Some of the MVPs have already started blogging about it,&nbsp;Andrews has <A href="http://blogs.vbcity.com/shandy/archive/2005/02/13/1056.aspx">posted</A> his first impressions and Manzi has some <A href="http://manzi.weblogs.us/archives/025380.html">pics</A> as well.</P>
