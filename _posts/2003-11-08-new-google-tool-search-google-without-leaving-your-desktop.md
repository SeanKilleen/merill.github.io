            Something new from the folks at Google.&#160; Search Google without leaving your desktop
            with the <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/deskbar/index.html">Google Desk Bar</a>.&#160;
            This is interesting, it does a nifty little popup window with the results.&#160; Let's
            see if it as useful as the Google Explorer Bar which is awesome at popup blocking.
