<p>Looks like I somehow missed this. Free vouchers for the .NET 4 (Visual Studio 2010 Beta Exams) are available online in the <a href="http://borntolearn.mslearn.net/btl/b/weblog/archive/2010/03/17/register-for-visual-studio-2010-beta-exams.aspx">Born to Learn</a> blog.</p>  <p>I couldn’t register for the 71-515 (TS: Web Application Development with .NET 4) exam as it was booked up but there were seats still available for the other two exams that I registered for today.</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-519&amp;locale=en-us">Exam 71-519: Pro: Designing and Developing Web Applications Using Microsoft .NET Framework 4</a></li>    <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-513&amp;locale=en-us">Exam 71-513: TS: Windows Communication Foundation Development with Microsoft .NET Framework 4</a></li> </ul>  <p>You need to take the exams before 30-Apr, so you have almost a month to get prepared. You can also make use for the pilot beta preparation resources that other candidates are sharing, see the ‘<a href="http://borntolearn.mslearn.net/btl/b/weblog/archive/2010/03/22/preparing-for-the-visual-studio-2010-beta-exams.aspx">Preparing for the Visual Studion 2010 beta exams</a>’ post by Krista.</p>
