    <p>
        I suddenly realised that September is creeping up next month and I have not been able
        to do a single Microsoft certification on the .NET exams. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So I've now taken on a sort of Mission Impossible trying to do the five exams to get
        my MCSD.NET&#160;before 31-Sep.&#160;I will be starting with the Web Development exam
        next Tuesday and do two more this month and then try the other two next month. All
        current MCSD get a free voucher for the Analysing Requirements exam until 31. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This is going to be my certification track.<br />
