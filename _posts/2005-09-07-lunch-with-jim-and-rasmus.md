<p>During lunch today I was joined at my table by <a href="http://www.lerdorf.com/">Rasmus Lerdof</a> (the creator of PHP) and Jim 
Zemlin the executive director of FSG (Free Standards Group). Jim is the guy who 
pushes the Linux Standards Base and tries to ensure that Linux doesn't fragment 
the way that Unix did.</p>
<p>Both&nbsp;Rasmus and Jim&nbsp;were enjoying their stay in Colombo and Jim was 
really into the Sri Lankan culinary, he was going for seconds as well which is 
quite rare given how spicy Sri Lankan food generally is.</p>
<p>The session following lunch was taken by the lively <a href="http://danesecooper.blogs.com/divablog/">Danese Cooper</a>&nbsp;from 
Intel. Danese has a funky unofficial title as the Open Source Diva and one of 
her key achievements was to lobby Sun into open sourcing Open Office during the 
time she was employed there. </p>
<p>The session that is currently in progress is by Hugo Wisidagama, the director 
of <a href="http://www.mnetplus.com/">MNet</a>. MNet is a local software service 
company that is focused on providing services based on open source service. 
Their unique business model is built on selling their expertise on various open 
source software stacks to companies.</p>
