To create a new folder in windows explorer pre Win8 was Alt+F, N.

In Windows 8 it's Alt+H, N

There are many new shortcuts like Alt+F,S to start PowerShell etc.. The neat advantage with the ribbon bar is that you press Alt and can see the shortcut letters displayed so you don't need to memorise these things.
