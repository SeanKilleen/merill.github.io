<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cbrumme">Chris Brumme</a> is the father of all .NET bloggers. His posts are more like booklets on the CLR that I usually print them and read it off-line. Half-way through a single post of his and my head usually starts aching, but since he hasn&rsquo;t posted in a long while the community is getting together to get him to start posting in again. I&rsquo;m joining the campaign. Post Chris, post.</p>
<p><em>Chris Brumme... come home!:</em> </p>
