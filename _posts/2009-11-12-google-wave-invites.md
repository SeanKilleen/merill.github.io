UPDATE: No more invites. Sorry guys I've given away all my invites on a first-come first-serve basis. Cheers!

I’ve given away most of my invites over Twitter but there are a few remaining though. So if you’d like a wave invite drop me a mail or leave a comment with your email address.

One tip I’ve found useful on my first day is to see public waves using <strong>with:public</strong>. The list is like a fire hose so I usually add some criteria e.g. ‘sharepoint with:public’ to see all public sharepoint waves.
