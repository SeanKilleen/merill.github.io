            Simon Willison has a really cool article which points out simple things that you can
            do to make html forms extremely easy to use. This is a must read for any web developer.

            My second article for SitePoint has been published: <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/1273" title="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/1273">Simple
            tricks for more usable forms</a>. It examines a whole bunch of <acronym>CSS</acronym> and
            Javascript tricks for improving the usability of web based forms without impairing
            their accessibility to clients that don't support those technologies. The article
            has already had some useful feedback on the forums, including the valuable observation
            that auto-selecting the contents of a form field when it receives the focus can have
            a negative effect on the usability of Unix browsers, where mouse buttons are frequently
            used for coping and pasting.
