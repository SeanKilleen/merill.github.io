<p>Fear no more the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=sqlhost&amp;title=Database%20Publishing%20Wizard">Database Publishing Wizard</a> is here to help. </p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>The Database Publishing Wizard enables the deployment of SQL Server 2005 databases into a hosted environment on either a SQL Server 2000 or 2005 server. It generates a SQL script file which can be used to recreate the database in shared hosting environments where the only connectivity to a server is through a web-based control panel with a scripting window.</p>
<p>The Database Publishing Wizard is currently a command line tool, though future releases will add a graphical user interface.</p></blockquote>
