        Two down three more to go!

        This exam was easier than the Web exam and I was able to finish the exam in about
        an hour. The main reason for this would be that the topics were very similar, I guess
        I should have studied for the Windows exam first since the security and globalisation
        concepts are covered very well in the MOC course.

        Next up is the 70-320 Web Services and Server Components exam.
