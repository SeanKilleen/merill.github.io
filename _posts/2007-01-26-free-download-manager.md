<p>I&rsquo;ve been a long-time user of <a href="http://www.leechget.net/">LeechGet</a><font color="#0066cc"> </font>for managing my downloads but had problems running it under Vista.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/">Internet Download Manager</a> was a good choice until I ran out of the trial period.</p>
<p>Today I found out about <a href="http://www.freedownloadmanager.org/">Free Download Manager</a> which is free, no ads or spyware and is not hobbled by any maximum limit on the number of downloads. It also doubles&nbsp;up as a Site Downloader. Best of all, something my network admins would love is that I can control the amount of bandwidth it uses by selecting a light, medium or heavy load.</p>
<p>One innovative feature that I&rsquo;ve encountered just now is the social aspect of commenting on the file that I just downloaded and also to see others opinion on it. I&rsquo;ve seen these in torrent and other p2p software but for the first time in a download manager.</p>
