            It may have taken Microsoft years, but the company finally has put together a reasonably
            clear primer on .Net. Remember that for several years after announcing .Net, people
            were still scratching their heads trying to figure out exactly what the initiative
            was. This new introduction, posted on Saturday (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/basics/whatis.asp" title="http://www.microsoft.com/net/basics/whatis.asp">here</a>),
            is a pretty straightforward explanation of what is .Net.
