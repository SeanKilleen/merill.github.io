            I opened my browser a second ago, and a butterfly busted out of the page. What are
            they feeding that thing? At any rate, I like the new <a href="http://www.msn.com" title="http://www.msn.com">MSN.com</a>.
            I was a beta tester for MSN9, so I finally get a chance to talk about it a bit. MS
            really puts a lot behind MSN... I was surprised when three weeks ago, a limited edition
            gold-plated MSN 9 CD showed up on my doorstep (It's real gold, I had it checked).
            That's one hell of a beta tester thank you. And all I got for Office 11 was a lousy
            keychain.

            &#160;Anyways, the new MSN home page is really well organized. I like the color-coded
            sections, and what not. The best part of all is MyMSN, which, I think might be using
            the ASP.NET 2.0 WebPart framework, or some derivative thereof. It's pretty frickin
            cool. I'm working on making my custom home page right now. Now someone just needs
            to come with an RSS feed provider so I can show the top 5 items from my favorite feeds
            there. I'd never have any other home page. It seems to be not letting me save my preferences
            right now, but hopefully they'll fix that. Maybe I need to enable cookies for this
            site, since I'm on IE6 SP2.... Nope, must be a technical glitch.

            MSN Video is pretty cool too. The picture is bigger, and it's definitely much more
            visually appealing than it's predecessor. It even has an <a href="http://g.msn.com/0US!s0.31751_317621/MY.2045?http://g.msn.com/0VD0/09/32&amp;&amp;cm=DrizzleUpsell" title="http://g.msn.com/0US!s0.31751_317621/MY.2045?http://g.msn.com/0VD0/09/32&amp;&amp;cm=DrizzleUpsell">Enhanced
            client</a> that installs locally, offering high-res playback at 750kps. I'm pretty
            sure it's a .NET app, because it's using the VS.NET generic installer screens, which
            is kindof surptising, but oh well.
        </p>
        <p>
            All and all, it's a beautiful, functional upgrade. I'd highly recommend checking it
            out. You might make it your home page again.
