    <p>
        Finally, took my last exam for the MCSD.NET today. This was the Designing and Implementing
        Databases with SQL Server 2000 exam and I scored 87%.

    <p>
        Now I only need to take the Administering exam on SQL Server to get my MCDBA. But
        that'll have to wait till November as I don't have the time or the money to spend
        on exams for now.
