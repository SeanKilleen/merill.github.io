<p>Well this is my first post from Boston for 2005 (I wonder how many times I will be coming to Boston this year). Anyway I&rsquo;m in Boston for a company Boot Camp to kick things off on the building our next generation platform. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely been a pretty exciting week for me. I&rsquo;ve had a chance to meet up in person with people like Kevin Hegg (this guy coding is a piece of art), Dwijen Patel (a database guru), <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/">Greg Raiz</a> (an ex-Microsoftie) and Mihindu Senanayake (another ex-Microsoftie). </p>
<p>We are working on implementing a framework based on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/enterprise/msf/">MSF</a> at BTA and a lot of thought is going into how to customize the&nbsp;team and process models for BTA which is an application service provider. There is a lot of work ahead in terms of actually learning and applying the process successfully. I&rsquo;m even considering taking becoming an <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/techguide/msf/msfprac.mspx">MSF Practitioner</a> when I get back to Colombo. (Update: By the time I was coming to the end of writing this post I already browsed over to the MCT Download Center and started downloading the course materials for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/syllabi/en-us/1846Afinal.mspx">Course 1846 &ndash; Microsoft Solutions Framework Essentials</a>. I wonder&nbsp;if I will be able to read through all of it and be ready to take the exam by the time I reach&nbsp;Colombo on the 20th of this month).</p>
