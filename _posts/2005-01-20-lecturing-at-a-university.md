<DIV class=Section1>
<P>I’ve always felt that it would be an honor to lecture at a university and just after the completion of my Masters a couple of doors have opened. The first instance was at IIT where I myself did my Masters. Dr. Keerthi Premadasa who heads the place wanted to find out if I was available to do one of the courses on Object Oriented Programming. </P>
<P>Today, through Jinashri of Microsoft I was put in contact with Dr. Chandima of the University of Kelaniya for a new course they want to start for their Masters on .NET. </P>
<P>With me leaving the country tomorrow for a month, plans have been put on hold till I return. Let’s wait and see what the future holds.</P></DIV>
