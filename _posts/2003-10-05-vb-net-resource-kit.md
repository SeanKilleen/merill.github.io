        There are some really great stuff in this resource kit that can be downloaded from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/vbrkit/">MSDN</a>.&#160;&#160;
    </p>
    <p>
        While the .NET Resource Kit is targeted at VB programmers, it comes with tons of real
        3rd party controls for free that work just as well for C# programmers as well as VB.NET
        programmers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are two extracts from the introductory letter on the resource kit by Chris Dias
        (Group Program Manager, Visual Basic Product Team).
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>The information on the Visual Basic .NET Resource Kit CD is organized by common
        development task: Windows programming, Web and XML Web services programming, mobile
        device programming, and data access. Each of these major categories is further organized
        by several common subcategories, including Conceptual Overviews, Code Samples, Step-by-Step
        Walkthroughs and Quick Start Guides, Training and Certification, Best Practices Sample
        Applications, Recommended Reading, and Sample Book Chapters. </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>The CD also contains an impressive collection of free .NET controls from leading
        control vendors such as ComponentOne, Dundas, Infragistics, SAX software, and others.
        Building and distributing your applications using these controls will dramatically
        reduce your development time.</em>
