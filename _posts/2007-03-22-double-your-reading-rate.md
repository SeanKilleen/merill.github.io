<p>I'm always on the lookout for productivity tips that help me be a better myself. </p> <p>I used to love <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog">Steve Pavlina</a> but&nbsp;most of his&nbsp;posts in the last six&nbsp;months or so have been quite bland. </p> <p>Enter <a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/">Scott Young</a>. This <a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2007/03/10/double-your-reading-rate/">article on doubling your reading rate</a> is good. I'm hoping is other stuff is the same.</p> <p>Aside: Moving to a new house (my very own one!), <a href="http://www.joshuaf.net">the baby</a>&nbsp;and some other stuff have been disrupting my usual flow. Hopefully you'll be hearing more from me again...</p>
