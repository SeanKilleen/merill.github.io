<p>Okay, I admit it. I&rsquo;m a <a href="http://www.jkrowling.com/">J.K. Rowling</a> fan. (FYI: I&rsquo;m a serious <a href="http://www.danbrown.com/">Dan Brown</a> fan too, oh and <a href="http://www.jamesherriot.org/">James Herriot</a> as well.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m into the <a href="http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/books/prisoner/">third</a> Harry Potter book and I&rsquo;m loving it. It&rsquo;s a bit weird though to have first seen the film and then read the book. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made myself a promise though that this would be&nbsp;the last book I read for a long time while I spend more of my free time getting a hang on all the new Whideby stuff, I&rsquo;m especially intrigued by <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/teamsystem/">Team System</a>.</p>
