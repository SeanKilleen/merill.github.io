            I’m a heavy user of two Microsoft Applications Blocks, namely the Data Access block
            and the Exception Management block. I haven’t been able to use UI block in any of
            my projects yet but this new block ‘Authorization and Profile Application’ looks promising.
            Check out the Microsoft Patterns and Practices <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/practices/audiences.asp">home
            page</a> for a list of very useful resources along with a list of all the Application
            Blocks.

            The Authorization and Profile Application Block is a reusable code component that
            builds on the capabilities of the Microsoft .NET Framework to help you perform authorization
            and access profile information.<br />
