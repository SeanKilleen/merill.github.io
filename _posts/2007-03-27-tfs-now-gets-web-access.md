<p>Microsoft just announced the acquisition of <a href="http://www.devbiz.com/">devbiz solutions</a>, the guys who make <a href="http://www.devbiz.com/teamplain/webaccess/details.aspx">TeamPlain Web Access</a>.</p> <p>The best part is that it's <a href="http://www.devbiz.com/teamplain/webaccess/download.aspx">free now</a>. If you've been holding off on TFS due to its lack of a web interface, there's no reason to wait anymore.</p>
