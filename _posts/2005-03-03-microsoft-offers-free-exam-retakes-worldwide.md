<P>Hey, all you people. This is the time to go bonkers taking Microsoft exams. Microsoft is giving a free “second-shot offer” to anyone who takes a Microsoft exam and fails between March 1 and May 31. Here’s some more info. </P>
<P><I>Last summer, Microsoft Corporation field tested a promotion that gave test takers a free retake on a failed exam. The offer was limited to the U.S. and was available on a select number of exams. On Monday, the company announced that it was reviving the offer again this time allowing retakes on all of its Microsoft Certified Professional exams and expanding the program worldwide.</I> </P>
<P><I>The "Second-Shot Offer" allows anyone taking and failing an MCP exam from March 1 until May 31 to retake that exam. According to the offer posted on the MCP site, candidates can retake an exam only once, but the retake can be applied to as many exams as a candidate can take until the offer ends.</I> </P>
<P><I>Registration is required for candidates who want to participate. Also, exam retakes must be taken at the same testing center. Retakes must be completed by June 30. This offer cannot be combined with other offers. Other restrictions apply.</I> </P>
