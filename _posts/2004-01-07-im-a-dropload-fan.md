            A few days ago, I saw a post from someone about <a href="http://www.dropload.com" title="http://www.dropload.com">DropLoad.com</a>,
            a website that lets you leave files for people, and gives them a 48 hour window to
            download it. It's done in PHP, but what the heck, it's a great system. I hope they
            add some reporting features and what not... I'd gladly pay a monthly fee to use it.
            I'm using it to distribute the source code for Interscape's products when they are
            purchased. What a killer idea!! Thanks DropLoad!
