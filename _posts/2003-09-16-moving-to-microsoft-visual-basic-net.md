        Thanks a lot for everyone who came to the seminar yesterday. I hope you all saw the
        power and productivity gains of moving to the .NET platform. I started working with
        .NET nearly two years ago and have never looked back. The rest of the development
        world pales in comparison to what you can do with .NET.

        I feel that not a lot of developers in Sri Lanka know enough about .NET. .NET is going
        to one of the key development skills required in the future. We Sri Lankans need to
        master these technologies to keep our competitive edge over our conterparts from India
        and other countries.
