<p>You&rsquo;ll need to change the timezone on your&nbsp;box to be +5.30 (India Standard Time) until we have a service pack release from Microsoft that&nbsp;moves Sri Lanka back into the +5.30 offset.</p>

<p>Note that changing just the time is a fruitless exercise as the time server will reset it on a periodic basis.</p>
<p>You have been warned! Resistance is futile.</p>
