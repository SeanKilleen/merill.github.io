            Last year I completed my MSc in IT from Keele, this is through the Informatics IIT
            centre in Colombo. Unfortunately even though Keele and IIT are private institutes
            their delays in announcing results to students makes them no different from the universities
            in Colombo. In addition to this we had to pay out a hefty sum for the course. One
            would think that at least their service would have been comparatively better.

            Anyway I&rsquo;ve just written out a mail to them and I&rsquo;m hoping that at the
            very least I would get a prompt reply.

            You might think from this rant that I don&rsquo;t have anything good to say about
            Keele and IIT, on the contrary there were many positives and high points during my
            stay there but I&rsquo;ll leave that out for another post.
