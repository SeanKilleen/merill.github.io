<p>The day is finally here, five teams were chosen from over forty-five entries from almost all the universities in Sri Lanka. Today evening at the Taj, each team will present their <a href="http://www.imaginecupsrilanka.com/">Imagine Cup</a> entry to a panel of judges as well as an audience that includes their colleagues, lecturers, industry as well as the media.</p>
<p>One team is going to emerge victorious and will be makings its way to the global finals in India where they will compete with the other national winners.</p>
<p>AirNow, the team that I mentored, spent quite a lot of time over the past weekend as well as the last two days, polishing up on the presentation and demos. I got them to do something cheeky by including a quote by Steve Jobs on <a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html">connecting the dots</a>&nbsp;;)</p>
<p>Best of luck to all the teams!</p>
