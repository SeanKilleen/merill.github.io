            <a href="http://www.opensourcetesting.org/">Open Source Testing</a> is a compendium
            of 138 open source testing tools, including unit testing, feature testing, performance
            testing, bug tracking, the whole gamut. If you're considering building some testing
            infrastructure, you should spend some time looking around here first.
