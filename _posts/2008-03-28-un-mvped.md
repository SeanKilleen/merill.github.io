It had to happen. Two years ago I made a conscious decision to make my family the center of my universe and my #1 priority. <a href="http://www.joshuaf.net/">Joshua</a> is now 16 months and <a href="http://www.rafaelf.com/">Rafael</a> is 2 months old, these are the best years of my life and I want to make every minute count with them!

This of course means sacrifices and the MVP is one of them. However it does not take away the immense joy and satisfaction I get from seeing the Sri Lanka .NET user group grow to be one of the largest in the country. And Wela has a few more <a href="http://welasharp.net/Default.aspx?blogid=2008032701">tricks</a> up his sleeve so keep watch.
