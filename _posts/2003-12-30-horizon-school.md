            Check out <a href="http://www.horizon77.org/">Horizon school</a> situated in Mahavilachchiya
            in the Anuradhapura district. It is a small informal IT school which is taking giant
            leaps and bringing out stories into the open. I hope these kids could one day be able
            to have their own blogs so that we in Sri Lanka know how each other live and help
            make changes in people&rsquo;s lives.
