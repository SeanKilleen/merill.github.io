            When you can write <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/nchikada/pac/" target="_blank" title="http://www.geocities.jp/nchikada/pac/">nearly
            perfect versions of PacMan and Space Invaders</a> in your favorite productivity application,
            you know it's crossed the boundary. Of course, treating cells like pixels and implementing
            the game by changing the background colors probably wasn't what the Excel developers
            had in mind, but frankly, that's not much different than what the guys writing the
            original games had to deal with. Wow.<br />
