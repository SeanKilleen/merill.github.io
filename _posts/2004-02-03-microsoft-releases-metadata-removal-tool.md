            A year ago, 10 Downing Street published a dossier on Iraq's security and intelligence
            organisations. It was cited by none other than Colin Powell in his address to the
            United Nations. Then a lecturer in politics at Cambridge University discovered that
            much of the 19-page document was copied from three different articles, one written
            by a graduate student.

            MS Word is notorious for containing private information in file headers, but not any
            longer. Microsoft has quietly released a tool to scrub leaky metadata from documents
            edited with its software. The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=144e54ed-d43e-42ca-bc7b-5446d34e5360&amp;displaylang=en">Remove
            Hidden Data Add-In</a> will permanently remove hidden and collaboration data, such
            as change tracking and comments, from MS Word, MS Excel, and MS PowerPoint files.
