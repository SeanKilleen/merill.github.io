<p>If your currently working on more than one project take a couple of minutes to read Jeff Atwoord&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000691.html">post on multi-tasking</a>. He concludes with:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>I've often pushed back on demands to work on multiple projects at the same time. It can be <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000109.html"><font color="#355ea0">difficult to say no</font></a>, because software developers are notoriously prone to the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000284.html"><font color="#355ea0">occupational hazard of optimism</font></a>. 
<p>We typically <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000626.html"><font color="#355ea0">overestimate how much we'll actually get done</font></a>, and multi-tasking exaggerates our own internal biases even more. Whenever possible, avoid interruptions and avoid working on more than one project at the same time. If it's unavoidable, <b>be brutally honest with yourself-- and your stakeholders-- about how much you can actually get done under multi-tasking conditions.</b> It's probably less than you think. </p></blockquote>
