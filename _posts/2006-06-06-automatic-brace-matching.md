<P>The Visual Studio shortcut of the day is CTRL+] which allows you to jump between two matching braces. The name is somewhat misleading since brace matching works not just for braces but also includes parentheses and all other pair statements like <STRONG>#region</STRONG> - <STRONG>#endregion</STRONG>, <STRONG>#if</STRONG> and so on.</P>
<P>All you have to do is move the cursor to either the left or right of a brace and press CTRL+] to toggle moving between the two ends in the code editor.</P>

<P>A word of warning to Visual Basic users, you guys don't uses braces so you don't get the Automatic Brace Matching feature. Ouch.</P>
