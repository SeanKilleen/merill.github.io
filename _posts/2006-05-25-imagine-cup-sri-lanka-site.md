<p>Wela <a href="http://www.welasharp.net/Default.aspx?blogid=2006052401&amp;showblogitem=yes">announced</a> yesterday about the launch of <a href="http://www.imaginecupsrilanka.com/">www.imaginecupsrilanka.com</a>. As usual a job well done by Wela and team which included both Razor and Charith.</p>
<p>The finals take place next Wednesday and is going to be much bigger than last time. Amity (AirNow), the team that I&rsquo;m mentoring has a good chance of winning (I haven&rsquo;t seen much of the other presentations though) and I wish them all the luck.</p>
<p>Another plus to my team is that it is dominated by women with a ratio of 3 to 1. In Sri Lanka &lsquo;Women in IT&rsquo; is alive and kicking. The way these geek girls move around so comfortably within the Visual Studio tools can put many guys I know&nbsp;to shame. They tell me that they&rsquo;ve only been using Visual Studio in the last five months which I find very hard to believe.</p>
<p>AirNow is going to KICK ASS!</p>
<p>PS: If you would like to come see the finals register at the site, there are a few slots available to the public.</p>
