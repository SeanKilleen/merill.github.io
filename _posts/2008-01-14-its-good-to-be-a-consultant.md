<p>I'm working as a consultant for the first time in my ten year career and I'm loving every minute of it.</p> <p>In the last couple of months I've worked in three very diverse teams, in three different offices and three different technology areas ranging from VB6 Interop + ASP.NET at Kelloggs, WinForms + EntLib + Oracle + Mainframe integration at Microsoft and now SharePoint (MOSS 2007) at Lend Lease.</p> <p>The quantity &amp; quality of things that you learn from interacting with such diverse people is mind blowing. For now, I'm going to sit back and enjoy the ride!</p>
