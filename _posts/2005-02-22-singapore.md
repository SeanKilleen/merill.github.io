<P>This is the last leg of my long trip back to Colombo. It's really cool that the Changi Airport at Singapore has free internet access.</P>
<P>What have I been doing the past 48hrs of travelling, well I've been reading Code Complete by Steven McCowell. Unfortunately I made a mistake when I ordered the book and ended up with the original version rather than the recently released Code Complete 2 book.</P>
<P>The book is heavy on procedural programming but it's amazing that a lot of the concepts and practical advice is still applicable to the real world applications that we write today. Code Complete 2 is a book that should be on the desk of every developer, not only is it a good read, it's a good handbook to refer to.</P>
