            News</a> is running an article on new search paradigms. I went to check them out. <a href="http://www.groxis.com/service/grok" title="http://www.groxis.com/service/grok">Grokker</a> sounds
            interesting (&ldquo;..</span><span lang="EN">a downloadable program that not only
            sorts search results into categories but also "maps" the results in a holistic way,
            showing each category as a colorful circle&hellip;&rdquo;)</span> but the site seems
            to be struggling to cope with the spike in traffic it must be getting, as I couldn&rsquo;t
            even get the page to resolve properly after a half a dozen tries. <a href="http://www.vivisimo.com/" title="http://www.vivisimo.com/">Vivisimo</a> has
            an interesting concept. It puts the search results into clusters which appear in a
            left-hand task pane. This way, if you search on &ldquo;Napoleon&rdquo;, you can quickly
            see which of your results are books appearing at Amazon, which are history sites,
            which are ebay auctions, etc.
