ðŸš€ I just launched my weekend hack project ðŸ¦‹. With Twitter becoming unusable a whole heap of the Microsoft community is now on Bluesky and having a blast.

I made [Bluesky.ms](https://bluesky.ms) to make it easy to find each other. If you are already on Bluesky, add your profile so others can find you.

If you haven't started on Bluesky here's a primer.

## ðŸ¦‹ What is Bluesky?

Bluesky is a social app that is designed to not be controlled by a single company. It's an open network and a version of social media where it's built by many people, and it still comes together as a cohesive, easy-to-use experience.

## âœ… Where do I sign up

* Web â†’ [Bluesky Web app](https://bsky.social)
* iPhone â†’ [Bluesky iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bluesky-social/id6444370199)
* Android â†’ [Bluesky Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.blueskyweb.app&hl=en)

## ðŸš€ How do I find people?

Rebuilding all the folks you know or finding people with similar interests take time. Here are some neat ways to bootstrap the process.
