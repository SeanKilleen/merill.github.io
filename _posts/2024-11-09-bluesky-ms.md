ðŸš€ I just launched my weekend hack project ðŸ¦‹. With Twitter becoming unusable a whole heap of the Microsoft community is now on Bluesky and having a blast.

I made [Bluesky.ms](https://bluesky.ms) to make it easy to find each other. If you are already on Bluesky, add your profile so others can find you.

If you haven't started on Bluesky here's a primer.

## ðŸ¦‹ What is Bluesky?

Bluesky is a social app that is designed to not be controlled by a single company. It's an open network and a version of social media where it's built by many people, and it still comes together as a cohesive, easy-to-use experience.

## âœ… Where do I sign up

* Web â†’ [Bluesky Web app](https://bsky.social)
* iPhone â†’ [Bluesky iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bluesky-social/id6444370199)
* Android â†’ [Bluesky Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.blueskyweb.app&hl=en)

## ðŸš€ How do I find people?

Rebuilding all the folks you know or finding people with similar interests take time. Here are some neat ways to bootstrap the process.

### âœ… Starter Packs

These are lists of Bluesky users that you can bulk follow. The starter packs help you quickly get started on Bluesky and follow folks in the Microsoft community.

See [bluesky.ms/starterpacks](https://bluesky.ms/starterpacks) for the latest list.

You can also find other non-Microsoft starter packs over at [blueskydirectory.com/starter-packs](https://blueskydirectory.com/starter-packs)

âœ… Help others find you

If you write about Microsoft content and want others to find you, add your profile over at [bluesky.ms](https://bluesky.ms).

This crowd sourced database welcomes everyone. If you find it's missing anyone please feel free to add them in.

Let's build some awesome open communities!
