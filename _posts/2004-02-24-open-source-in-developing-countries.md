            <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0111930">Sanjiva Weerawarana</a> the Chairman and
            Executive Director of the LSF (<a href="http://www.opensource.lk/">Lanka Software
            Foundation</a>) and Jivaka Weeratunga (my former boss) have released a very detailed
            report (114 pages) titled &lsquo;<a href="http://www.sida.se/content/1/c6/02/39/55/SIDA3460en_Open%20SourceWEB.pdf">Open
            Source in Developing Countries</a>&rsquo;. The report gives an overview of the open
            source phenomenon and then outlines various business models based on open source and
            implementation strategies.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            I learnt quite a lot on how open source can help developing countries through an interesting
            interview with Linus Torvalds in the report&rsquo;s appendix.
