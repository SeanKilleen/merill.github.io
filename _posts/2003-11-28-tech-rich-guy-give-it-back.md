            Shel Israel <a href="http://seems2shel.typepad.com/itseemstome/2003/11/gates_hating_an.html">talks</a> about
            the rich guys who are giving their fortunes back to improve the world. Notable is
            the Bill and Melinda Gates who have donated half their wealth in this year alone.

            I too really want to do this although I might not be rich enough to give away money
            but am certainly looking forward to volunteering my time to help out in good causes.
            The only problem is that I can&rsquo;t seem to find enough free time on my hands.
