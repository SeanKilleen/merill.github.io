            Using Scott Watermasysk's <a href="http://www.dottext.com/">.Text</a> program, over
            150 Microsoft bloggers can now be found at <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/">blogs.msdn.com</a>.
            This is sure to be not only a wealth of interesting technical information, but additionally
            a way to really get to know many of the developers who are working at Microsoft. It's
            sometimes difficult to remember that these folks are developers, just like you. You
            will find blogs from well known devs at MS such as Don Box, Scott Guthrie, Rob Howard,
            Chris Anderson, Yasser Shohoud and Paul Vick as well as Program Managers and people
            who work on MSDN. Some blogs are "team blogs" such as the BCLTeam and the C++ Testing
            Team. Not only do you get lots of great info, but some fundamental insight to how
            things work at Microsoft and how you can be involved in the process.
