        I've been hearing a lot about Generics the past few months and how&#160;it's going
        to&#160;let us write less code and more robust code. I have looked at templates in
        C++ before but didn't quite get the hang of it. <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/reports/pdc/2003/mccarthy/">This
        article</a> on FTPOnline gives a really good introduction.

        Imagine that, now I can remove all the collections&#160;class that I've used in my
        data tier for each table and replace them with just&#160;a single&#160;Generic class.

        I can't wait till next June for Whideby, give&#160;me .NET 2.0 now!!!&#160;
