    <p>
        I come across so many web sites that ask for an email address just to do a download
        or to access some site and then spam that address.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mailinator does a neat trick for me,&#160;I just think&#160;of any&#160;name @mailinator.com&#160;and
        enter it&#160;to the site and then go over to <a href="http://www.mailinator.com">mailinator.com</a>&#160;and
        type in the address that I gave and login to the site! 
    </p>

        I know you can do it anyway by creating a dummy mail account at hotmail and then provide
        that but the past part here is that you don't need to remember any passwords to check
        the mail, just the address would do.
