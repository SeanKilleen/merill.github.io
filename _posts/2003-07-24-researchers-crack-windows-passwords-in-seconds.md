        'Swiss researchers have developed a password-cracking scheme, based on a method first
        developed in 1980, that lets them crack most Windows passwords in about 13 seconds
        (the original method takes more than a minute and a half longer).' <a href="http://www.wininformant.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=39646">WinInfo</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        But what the article doesn't say is that this is only true for the older encryption
        methods which use LanManager but does not apply to the new encryption techniques in
        Win2K, Win2K3.
