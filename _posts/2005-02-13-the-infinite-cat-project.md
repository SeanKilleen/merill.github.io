<P>Check out the <A href="http://www.infinitecat.com">Infinite Cat Project</A>, that only a geek would think of. It's a picture of a cat watching a cat watching a cat watching a cat... and you can even add your own cat to the project. Start off somewhere from the 25th cat and work your way to the first cat, it's really cool!</P>
<P>Now, is there an infinite dog project somewhere?</P>
