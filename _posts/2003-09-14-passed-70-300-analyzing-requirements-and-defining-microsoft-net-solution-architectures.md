    <p>
        The exam consisted of three case studies having 15, 10 and 7 questions. My preparation
        for this exam was reading the MOC <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/traincert/syllabi/2710bfinal.asp">Course
        2710</a> Analyzing Requirements and Defining Microsoft .NET Solution Architectures.
        For anyone planning to take this exam but who can't get their hands on this, read
        up a lot about the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/itsolutions/tandp/innsol/default.asp">MSF
        Process Model</a>, particularly the Planning Phase and know the distinctions between
        the Conceptual, Logical and Physical Models. 
    </p>

        Now I've just got to do one more exam to complete my MCSD.NET, hope I can take it
        by this Friday then I would have completed all five MCSD exams in just five weeks.
