<P>I found out last week that my boss, <A href="http://bta.cc/page.asp?section=whoweare">Thusith Mahanama</A>, the CEO of&nbsp;my company reads my blog! </P>
<P>Wow, gotta be careful ;)&nbsp; But&nbsp;seriously how many CEOs are techy enough to be reading blogs, he didn't know about <A href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Reference/Libraries/Library_and_Information_Science/Technical_Services/Cataloguing/Metadata/RDF/Applications/RSS/News_Readers/">news readers</A> though.</P>
<P>Just as&nbsp;a refresher to all you folks who are new to RSS and read my blog on a browser, you can instead install an RSS reader on your machine (try <A href="http://www.jetbrains.com/omea/reader/">Omea</A> it's free) and subscribe to RSS feeds, which is any site which shows an RSS icon like this <IMG alt="" hspace=0 src="/images/rssButton.gif" align=baseline border=0>. Then wait and see the news come to you without you needing to go to the news.</P>
<P>The Wall Street Journal has a good introduction to RSS including links to their own RSS feeds. Check it out <A href="http://online.wsj.com/public/page/0,,0_0813,00.html">here</A>.</P>
