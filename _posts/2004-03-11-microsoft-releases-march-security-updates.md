            Yesterday, the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) issued three new security
            bulletins, none of which is rated critical. One bulletin is rated important; the other
            two have moderate ratings. The bulletins highlight security flaws in Windows Media
            Services, Microsoft Office XP, and MSN Messenger, the company noted.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            The Office security flaw is the only vulnerability that could let malicious attackers
            run unwanted code on users' systems. The flaw affects systems running Office XP Service
            Pack 2 (SP2) and Microsoft Outlook 2002 SP2.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            The moderate security flaw for MSN Messenger 6.1 and MSN Messenger 6.0 could let attackers
            view--but not change or download--files on the victim's computer. Microsoft will fix
            the flaw in an upcoming version of the Instant Messaging (IM) application the company
            plans to issue.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            The moderate security flaw in Windows Media Services, which affects Windows 2000 SP4,
            SP3, and SP2, could let attackers send fake streaming-media requests that could shut
            down the service. That situation would be, in effect, a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            Microsoft switched to a monthly security-update release schedule last fall. "Microsoft
            is committed to helping customers keep their information safe, and releasing security
            bulletins on a regular, monthly schedule makes security response more predictable
            and easier for customers to manage," a company representative told me. You can download
            the patches that fix this month's security flaws from the Microsoft Web site.
