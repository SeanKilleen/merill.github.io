            In the .Net world, The Middleware Company is launching TheServerSide.NET, a free,
            online resource for enterprise .Net and architects and developers. A sibling of the
            company's TheServerSide.com site for Java developers, the .Net site will provide news,
            technical case studies, design patterns, and even satire for .Net developers while
            serving as a medium for knowledge exchange, according to the Middleware Company.
