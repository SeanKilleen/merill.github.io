            I know I promised to write about the APICTA awards, basically all I can say that it
            was a real waste of time. The final result was that none of the Sri Lankan contingent
            won any awards even though I and a lot other thought that some of them like the Interblocks,
            Emprise IT products (to name a few) deserved to win in their categories.

            All I can say is that the judging, which was carried out by 2-3 judges from each member
            country, were not fair or balanced with some of them blatantly giving high score for
            competitors from their own country.
