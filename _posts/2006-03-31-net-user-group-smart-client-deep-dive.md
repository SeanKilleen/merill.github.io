<p>The Sri Lankan .NET developer community will be given a rare treat today when <a href="http://www.maestros.net/pages/Mgmt%20Profile1.asp">Dr. Nitin Paranjape</a>&nbsp;an Office MVP does a talk on Developing VSTO Application at the NDB Auditorium at Navam Mawatha. </p>
<p>I have seen Dr. Nitin in action before and this guy is a truly gifted trainer and a great orator.&nbsp;You will understand what I mean when you see for yourself today.&nbsp;He follows a mantra of &lsquo;teaching people to learn&rsquo; and his sessions are thought provoking. No wonder then that he was picked as the best MCT trainer worldwide by Microsoft.</p>
<p>I will be going to the session today more because I want to see and learn from how he teaches than for his session on VSTO, which undoubtely is going to be fabulous on its own.</p>
<p>The other speakers at the Deep Dive will include <a href="http://welasharp.net/">Wela</a> on ClickOnce and <a href="http://thedeveloper.blogspot.com/">Prasanna</a> on DataBinding. If you are a Smart Client developer you owe it to yourself and your company to be there today.</p>
<p>This being our very first <a href="http://www.ineta.org/">INETA</a> meeting we&rsquo;ll also get to meet <a href="http://thespoke.net/blogs/howard">Howard Lo</a> from Microsoft Singapore (he&rsquo;s also a <a href="http://ch5.mediacorptv.com/eyeforaguy2/bios_howard.htm">star in Singapore</a>). Howard Lo is also the MVP Lead for Sri Lanka, so do definitely have a chat with him when you meet up today. He&rsquo;ll give you the low down on the MVP program and what plans he has for the Sri Lankan community.</p>
<p>This event is a brainchild <a href="http://jinath.weblogs.us/">Jinath </a>who relentlessly kept on banging doors to get the event going. Kudos to him and the rest of the team which included <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/dineshpriyankara">Dinesh</a>, <a href="http://thedeveloper.blogspot.com/">Prasanna</a> and the ever reliable <a href="http://welasharp.net/">Wela</a> for pulling this off in such a very short time.</p>
