            Microsoft plans to offer developers a pre-release version of its next Visual Studio
            .Net platform, codenamed Whidbey, next month, planning to drum up interest in its
            next generation Longhorn operating system, due in 2006.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            Whidbey will show off a new runtime model and various new application programming
            interfaces (APIs) that will be at the heart of all Longhorn applications. With both
            Longhorn and Whidbey extremely critical to Microsoft&rsquo;s future, the company is
            being more cautious about their release than it has been with previous products, which
            saw one beta and then shipment. Whidbey has already had one pre-release, and a third,
            full public beta will follow this one in midyear, before product shipment in late
            2004. [<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/31/35384.html">Read more</a>]
