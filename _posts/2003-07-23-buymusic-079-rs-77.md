        Buy.com has launched a music store with rates cheaper than Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes">iTune</a>.
        Hey now you can legally own your music for 77 bucks.

        My source for music will be the radio until the song prices cost around&#160;Rs. 10/-
        ($0.10) for&#160;us in&#160;Sri Lanka.
