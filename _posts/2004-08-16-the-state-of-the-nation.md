style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:windowtext'>Everything seems to
be going downhill, I had to wait for an hour to get some fuel for my car. Interest
rates are supposed to go up by the end of the year. Will we Sri Lankans never
learn?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><font size=2 color="#333333" face=Arial><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>Fomenting religious
dissent was also part of the well orchestrated campaign of the then opposition,
but in government today, it is called upon to bell the cat with the JHU
demanding the Anti Conversion Bill be passed into law given the green light of
the Supreme Court. To top it all, with prices already skyrocketing, the
government last week asked the people to brace themselves for further hikes.<O:P>

<p class=MsoPlainText><font size=2 color="#333333" face=Arial><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333'>And the irony of it
all is that the very reasons adduced by the President and the UPFA for the
ouster of the UNF such as the preparation to negotiate the ISGA with the LTTE,
allowing the Tigers to set up camps in Trincomalee such as at Manirasakulam,
providing duty free facilities to bring vehicles and equipment to the country
in addition to helicopter rides and other violations of the ceasefire
agreement, are all reenacted today, now with the blessings of the very
President and the UPFA.<O:P> </span></font><o:p></o:p></p>
