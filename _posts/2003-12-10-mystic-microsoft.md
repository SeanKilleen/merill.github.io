            Brockschmidt</a>, former employee of Microsoft wrote this draft copy for his (new)
            book. Not sure if its been published yet or not but its very interesting. Its not
            about MS's products or about&#160;arguments&#160;over Linux/OpenSource etc. Its about
            the spiritual transformation which the author went through during his 8 years of work
            at MS. [via <a href="http://ramesharu.blogspot.com/" title="http://ramesharu.blogspot.com/">Ramesh</a>]
