        The <a href="http://docs.msdnaa.net/ark_new3.0/cd3/npage.htm">Academic Resource Kit
        Version 3.0</a> available off the <a href="http://www.msdnaa.net/">MSDN AA</a> website
        is a fantastic resource for anyone working with .NET technologies in an Academic Environment. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It's basically a single port of call for all the freely downloadable software associated
        with the Academic use of .NET, lectures, book chapters (and some whole books), sample
        applications and hands-on labs.
