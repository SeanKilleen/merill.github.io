        Although Office 2003 is slated to be released to the public in October, Microsoft
        has released <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office">Office 2003</a> for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/overview/default.asp">MSDN
        Universal</a> users. If you or your company is an MSDN Universal subscriber go grab
        your copy from the MSDN site!

        I've been using the beta now for nearly three months and Outlook is way over the edge
        (the junk mail filter captures nearly 99% of all my junk mail) plus the new Office
        product called <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/onenote/default.asp">One
        Note</a> has saved me countless number of minutes whenever I needed to write a quick
        note or search for old notes.
