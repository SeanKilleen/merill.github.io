<p>With everyone reporting that Windows 7 beta was very stable I upgraded both my wife’s Dell Studio and my Dell 64-bit XPS to Windows 7.</p>  <p>Both setups ran fine without a hitch although the upgrade route took a couple of extra hours with all the migrating of application and user settings.</p>  <p>The good news is that I’ve been using both for over a week without any major hitches. The only problems I’ve had so far are to do with the 64-bit install. The first one being Windows Live Mesh which stays forever at the ‘Live mesh is starting’ step (there doesn’t seem to be any kind of fix out for this) and Google Chrome which flat out doesn’t work unless you <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=5111f112bcd233e1&amp;hl=en">add a flag to it’s startup</a>. This seems to work for most cases except for a few place where it fails like the new Gmail Offline access using Gears.</p>
