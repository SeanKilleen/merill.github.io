            This got passed on to me by a colleague - good enough to pass on....

            The best motivational message of the day!!!
        </p>
        <p>
            One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours
            as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally he decided the animal was old
            and the well needed to be covered anyway, it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the
            donkey. He invited all his neighbours to come over and help him. They all grabbed
            a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well.
        </p>
        <p>
            At first, the donkey realised what was happening and cried horribly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieted down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer
            finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw. With every shovel
            of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake
            it off and take a step up. As the farmer's neighbours continued to shovel dirt on
            top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone
            was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off!
        </p>
        <p>
            Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of
            the well is to shake it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a stepping
            stone.&#160; We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving
            up! Shake it off and take a step up!
