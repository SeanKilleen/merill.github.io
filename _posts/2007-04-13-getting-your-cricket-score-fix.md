<p>Chandana is <a href="http://www.yeschandana.com/2007/04/live-updates-on-777.html">bitching about Dialog's</a> so called Live Updates on 777. </p> <p>I've found Sky's '<a href="http://mobile.sky.com/cricket_livescores.asp">Cricket Live Scores</a>'&nbsp;to be pretty reliable on my really lousy phone and I only spend a few cents each time I get an update.</p> <p>If you find the url too long to type:</p> <ol> <li>Go to <a href="http://google.com/m">google.com/m</a>&nbsp;  <li>Search for 'cricket'  <li>Sky is second on the list (BBC is #1 maybe they are better)</li></ol> <p>Remember to add 'Cricket Live Scores' to your bookmark and you wouldn't need to search each time.</p>
