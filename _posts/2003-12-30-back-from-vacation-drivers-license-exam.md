            Merry X&rsquo; Mas everybody! I&rsquo;ve been at home in the Majestic city of Kandy
            during the past few days. I didn&rsquo;t get to enjoy much though after having caught
            a bad flu and being in bed for three days. Anyways I&rsquo;m back at work and right
            now I&rsquo;m studying for my Driver&rsquo;s License exam tomorrow (it&rsquo;s the
            written on The Highway Code).
        </p>
        <p>
            I&rsquo;m pretty much using the book that my brother had bought and he has highlighted
            a bunch of places and asked me to study just those for the exam. I&rsquo;ve taken
            this test lightly since I figured they couldn&rsquo;t be as hard as the Microsoft
            ones. Anyway tomorrow we&rsquo;ll know. And if there isn&rsquo;t a nondisclosure clause
            on the exam (like what Microsoft has) then I&rsquo;ll be free to blog whatever questions
            I can remember. I tried searching online on Google for any past papers, sample questions
            but couldn&rsquo;t find any.
