            Shoba&rsquo;s (my batch mate) company zone24x7 is looking to recruit a bunch of people.
            The openings include Software Architect, Team Leads, Software Engineers, Software
            Engineers (Embedded Development), QA Manager and Test Developers. They are mostly
            looking for Microsoft Technologies (C, C++, VB &amp; VC++) plus some on Linux. Leave
            a comment with your address if you want me to mail you the whole advertisement.
