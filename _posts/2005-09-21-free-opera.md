<p>IE and Firefox get a new 'free' competitor. </p>
<p><em>Described as the fastest Web browser available on any platform, Opera 
pioneered several features that we now take for granted, including tabbed 
browsing. The latest version--code-named Merlin--is full-featured with an inline 
search box, a password manager, integrated security features, an integrated 
email and newsgroup client, and facilities for navigating its entire interface 
via voice or keyboard.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Opera freed its browser to better compete with Mozilla Firefox, a free 
browser alternative that has managed to secure more than 8 percent of the market 
over the past year. By comparison, Opera, which has been around for 10 years, 
has garnered only 1 percent to 2 percent of the overall browser market. Web 
browser experts have often hailed Opera's superiority to Firefox and 
market-leader Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE), but the earlier policy of 
charging for the privilege of using the product turned away many users. Now 
Opera hopes to make up the lost income from paid users via a link to Google in 
the search box.</em></p>
<p>My guess is that this would dampen Firefox's momentum since switchers from IE 
now have an option of either Opera or Firefox.</p>
<p>Go download Opera from <a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera.com</a>, it's 
just 3.6MB. I'll let you know soon if Opera entices me to drop <a href="http://www.maxthon.com">Maxthon</a>.</p>
