<p>There are quite a few new keyboard shortcuts in Windows 7 and some of them are a godsend when working on a multi-monitor setup. I can finally retire <a href="http://www.realtimesoft.com/ultramon/">UltraMon</a> just to get a keyboard shortcut for switching windows between monitors.</p>  <p>There are new shortcuts for maximizing, restoring and minimizing windows as well. I will now be retiring an old keyboard shortcut that I’ve been using since Windows 3.1 (if you didn’t know Alt+Space, X for maximizing and Alt+Space, R for restore and Alt+Space, N for minimize).</p>  <p>Here’s a full list of the new keyboard shortcuts from <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd451012.aspx">TechNet</a>, I couldn’t get the <strong>Win+(+/-)</strong> Zoom working though.</p>  <p>Windows 7 beta 1 includes some handy new shortcut key combinations that allow you to navigate and manage the Windows workspace more efficiently. Here are 10 new Windows 7 shortcuts that will help you speed up your workflow (“Win” means the Windows Key):</p>  <p><strong>Win+Home: </strong>Clear all but the active window    <br /><strong>Win+Space: </strong>All windows become transparent so you can see through to the desktop    <br /><strong>Win+Up arrow:</strong> Maximize the active window    <br /><strong>Win+Down arrow: </strong>Minimize the active window or restore the window if it's maximized    <br /><strong>Win+Left/Right arrows: </strong>Dock the active window to each side of the monitor    <br /><strong>Win+Shift+Left/Right arrows:</strong> If you've got dual monitors, this will move the active window to the adjacent monitor    <br /><strong>Win+T:</strong> Shift focus to and scroll through items on the taskbar    <br /><strong>Win+P: </strong>Adjust presentation settings for your display    <br /><strong>Win+(+/-):</strong> Zoom in/out    <br /><strong>Shift+Click a taskbar item: </strong>Open a new instance of that particular application</p>
