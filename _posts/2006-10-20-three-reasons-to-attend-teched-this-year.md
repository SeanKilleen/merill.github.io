<li>Sessions: There will be a total of 60 sessions and 8 (HOLs). This is nearly double the number of last year&rsquo;s sessions. Your getting more bang for your buck this time around.</li>
<li>Speakers: The speaker list this year is an impressive lineup with the likes of &lsquo;Matty&rsquo; Matthew Hardman (voted best speaker for TechEd 2002), Steve Riley (the man hackers hate and it pro&rsquo;s love), Dr. Nitin (super trainer), Kevin De Souza, Chad Hower, Vinod Kumar (dev guru), the list goes on&hellip;</li>

<blockquote>
<p>In basic calculus we learned that the first derivative of a function is the "rate of change" of the value of that function with respect to another variable.&nbsp; In the case of your career, the other variable is time.&nbsp; The basic equation for a developer career looks like this:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier,monospace" size="4"><strong>C = G + LT</strong></font></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>C is <strong>Cluefulness</strong>.&nbsp; It is defined as an overall measure of your capabilities, expertise, wisdom and knowledge in the field of software development.&nbsp; It is the measure of how valuable you are to an employer.&nbsp; It is the measure of how successful your career is.&nbsp; When you graph your career, C is on the vertical axis.</p>
<p>G is <strong>Gifting</strong>.&nbsp; It is defined as the amount of natural cluefulness you were given "at the factory".&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;each individual, G&nbsp;is a constant,&nbsp;but it definitely&nbsp;varies from person to person.</p>
<p>L is <strong>Learning</strong>.&nbsp; It is defined as the&nbsp;rate at which you&nbsp;gain (or lose) cluefulness over time.</p>
<p>T is <strong>Time</strong>.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;on the horizontal&nbsp;axis of&nbsp;your career&nbsp;graph.</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>As you can see above, your career success is determined by three variables, only one of which you can control:</p>
<ul>
<li>You obviously can't control T.&nbsp;&nbsp;Time marches forward mercilessly&nbsp;at the same rate for everyone.<br />
<li>You also can't control G.&nbsp; The truth is that some people are just naturally smarter than you are, and that's the way it is.&nbsp; But G is not the sole determiner of your success.&nbsp; I have known some truly gifted programmers with lame careers,&nbsp;and I have also known some less-gifted folks who have become extremely successful.<br />
<li>You <em>can</em> make choices which affect the value of L.&nbsp; In fact, you <em>do</em> make choices which affect the value of L, every day, whether you know it or not. </li></ul></blockquote>
