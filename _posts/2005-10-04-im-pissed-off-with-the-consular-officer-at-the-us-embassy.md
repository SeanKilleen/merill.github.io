<p>I've been seeing a lot of new lately on all the fun that the MVPs are having 
at the <a href="http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/gp/MVPSMT2005">Global MVP 
Summit</a> in Redmond and boy&nbsp;it pisses me off that none of our Sri Lankan 
MVPs were able to&nbsp;attend. </p>
<p>The simple reason being that the consular officer&nbsp;at the US visa office 
felt that the summit was not too important&nbsp;to attend for the MVPs. WTF does 
he know?</p>
