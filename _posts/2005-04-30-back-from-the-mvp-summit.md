<p>Just got back from the MVP Summit last evening and boy did we have fun. I&rsquo;ll be posting about what I&rsquo;ve seen and heard in the past week as soon as I can figure out which stuff I shouldn&rsquo;t blog about. Typical of Microsoft, we were asked to sign NDAs on most of the stuff relating to Longhorn, the next Office and the next Visual Studio (not Whideby the one after that).</p>
<p>What I can say though is that I&rsquo;ve met some truly wonderful people starting with MVPs from all over Asia to Microsofties in Singapore, India and Redmond. I&rsquo;ve made many friends and jelled with some really, really cool people who do work on the bleeding edge. Man, what more can a geek ask for!</p>
