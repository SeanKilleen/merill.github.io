<p>This month&rsquo;s user group meeting would go down as one of the funnier ones. Imagine me presenting in a pitch dark room with no lights, I only realized how hilarious it was after I&nbsp;saw Wela doing his presentation (mine was the first). All I could see from the back was his black silhouette against the presentation backdrop. I would definitely have been a sight to watch (and not in a good way).</p>
<p>Overall I enjoyed doing yesterday&rsquo;s presentation which had&nbsp;zero demos, but we really did spend time drilling through the CLR, exception handling, garbage collection best practices with a heavy dose of the IDisposable interface thrown in for good measure. </p>
<p>If you were at yesterday&rsquo;s session please do leave your comments (both good and bad are equally welcome).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also post the link to the slide once Wela uploads them somewhere.</p>
<p>Wela&rsquo;s presentation on CSS, Themes and Skins was quite insightful. I learnt a couple of tricks including Style Hierarchies in CSS as well as the abc&rsquo;s on ASP.NET Theming.</p>
