            My ex-boarding mate Hareen from <a href="http://www.millenniumit.com/index_flash.htm">MIT</a> sent
            me this really useful site called <a href="http://www.familycar.com/">The Family Car</a>.
            I haven&rsquo;t gone through it completely but the few pages I read explain the inner
            working and how best to use and look after my car in very clean, simple language for
            a lay person like me to easily grasp.
