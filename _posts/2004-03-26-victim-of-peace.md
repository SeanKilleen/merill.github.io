            The man who is seeking re-election as Sri Lanka's prime minister at April 2 polls
            halted an ethnic war raging for decades, but his handling of the peace process may
            have landed him in trouble.&#160;
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            Ranil Wickremesinghe, 55, has turned the vote into a referendum on his internationally-backed
            bid to secure a permanent peace deal with Tamil Tiger rebels after establishing a
            truce in place since February 2002.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            "The main issue at this election campaign is the peace process and the handling of
            the economy," Wickremesinghe said after unveiling a six-page document setting out
            his United National Party's program earlier this month.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            President Chandrika Kumaratunga had accused him of risking national security and conceding
            too much to Tigers.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            That was the basis for sacking the parliament controlled by him and calling polls
            four years ahead of schedule.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            A nephew of Sri Lanka's first executive president, Junius Jayewardene, Wickremesinghe
            wooed the West as well as neighbouring India to win unprecedented support for ending
            the island's ethnic bloodshed that has claimed over 60,000 lives since 1972.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            The dividends came in June last year when the international community promised US$
            4.5 bn in support of his peace drive to rebuild Sri Lanka.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            But while he was in Washington to meet President George W. Bush, Kumaratunga pulled
            the rug under his feet by taking away his control over security forces in November
            last year.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            What Wickremesinghe lacks in charisma, he makes up with his management skills.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            "His public relations is almost non-existent, but his conflict management skills are
            very sharp," said a close confidant referring to his talks with the Tigers.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            He managed to revive the economy in 2002 to record 4.0 percent growth, pulling the
            country from its first ever recession in 2001 when the GDP growth hit a negative 1.5
            percent.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            The markets also love Wickremesinghe. It was when he was effectively managing the
            economy that the country's stock exchange became the world's best gainer in early
            1994.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            It was set to establish another record last year just before the political crisis
            erupted and stockbrokers say the bourse is looking for a Wickremesinghe win. (Source:
