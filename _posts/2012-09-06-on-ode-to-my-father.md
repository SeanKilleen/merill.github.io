Hi Dadda,

I've wanted to write this note to you for a very long time. To let you know how much you've taught and inspired me with your life. I know that I don't have a really close relationship with you like I do with Mummy. That most of our time together is spent in awkward silence while we search for something to talk about. But I want to let you know today that you have been the cornerstone of my life.

Thank you Dadda for teaching me the true meaning of love. In your 35+ years of marriage I have never seen or heard you show any hatred to Mom.

Thank you for showing me that true love means sticking with and taking care of darling Mummy who is ill with Parkinson's.

Thank you for teaching me how to respect women by never ever raising your hand against Mummy.

Thank you for teaching me how to forgive and forget. Many people have wronged you but you never hold a grudge against anyone. You would forgive them in a heartbeat and let bygones be bygones.

You taught me morality. About always doing the right thing and to always be honest even when it is difficult. You went from being a very successful businessman to someone who doesn't have much for which the main reason was because of your honesty and refusal to bribe or cheat anyone.

You taught me the joy of giving and sharing what little you have with others, about going out of your way to help someone who can never repay you.

You taught me not to waste anything in life. Whether it be finances or the environment around you.

You taught me what it was to work hard. I was privileged enough to work under you. Although I hated it at that time as a teenager, I now value and cherish the work ethic that you instilled in me.

You didn't have it easy in life. Your mother died when you were just three. I can only imagine how hard it must have been to grow up without a mother's love.

You were a promising student in school but were robbed off your education when Grandpa had you leave school and start work in the family business. Because of this you made sure that your kids got the best education possible even when it was beyond your means. I didn't understand then but having my own family now I realise that you sacrificed quite a lot to send us to the best school possible.

You believed in me. Thinking back, if I ever showed an interest in something you made sure that I explored it. From playing the guitar and organ (which I can't do to this day) to karate lessons, soccer and basketball lessons.

It took a lot of courage for you to let me drop out of school and follow my dream. You gave me the freedom to go after what I was passionate for. You believed in me and supported me.

One of my most favourite childhood memories is going for a swim after Sunday school. It took you less than two months to teach me how to do it. Oh the wonderful times we had.

Thank you dad for showing me that it takes a lot of courage, strength and self-control to stand by your convictions. That it takes more man to stay away from the vices of drinking and smoking.

Thank you for loving me unconditionally to this day.

Thank you for showing me how to live a life of service to others. You now dedicate your time to helping people. From running errands for various non-profits like the Little Sisters of the Poor, to visiting those who are sick or in prison and praying with them, to writing daily devotionals and sharing the Good News.

Thank you for showing me that it's never too late to make your dreams come true, at 53 your now reading for a Bachelors in Theology and kicking ass by coming out on top in class!

Above everything else I want to thank you for the deep, personal and meaningful relationship you have with your Saviour and friend Jesus. You paved the way for me to find the one eternal treasure in life that is worth living for.

I love you Dadda.
