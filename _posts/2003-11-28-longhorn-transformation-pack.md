            &#160;If you have Windows XP or Windows 2003 then you have got to download and apply
            the <a href="http://windowsx.techconnect.ws/enhance/myvs/lhtrans.html">Longhorn Transformation
            Pack</a>, the Plex theme include is way cool and makes your taskbar smaller giving
            you extra real-estate space on your screen. Some of my coworkers are green with envy
            over my desktop. (Remember to backup your data, the Transformation Pack has been reported
            to have screwed up a number of machines).
