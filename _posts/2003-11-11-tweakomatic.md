            The Tweakomatic is a nifty new utility that writes scripts that allow you to retrieve
            and/or configure Windows and Internet Explorer settings. So what, you might ask. Well,
            think about it. Because these are WMI scripts, they can be used to configure settings
            on remote computers. Need to change something on a remote machine? Then haul out the
            Tweakomatic. And think about this: because the Tweakomatic writes scripts, you could
            do something like run these scripts as logon or logoff scripts. In other words, you
            could quickly, easily, and automatically configure settings on any or all the computers
            in your organization. Get it <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=bd328d1e-6c01-4447-bd7c-c09646d722c8&amp;displaylang=en">here</a>.
