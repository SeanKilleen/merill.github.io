Locked the two boys in their room and told them I was calling Child Services to take them away. They start packing and bawling because I kept yelling at them that they would never be back. Then I actually made a phone call and came back into their room an hour later telling them they didn't accept shitty little kids at the orphanage because they were full of them.
