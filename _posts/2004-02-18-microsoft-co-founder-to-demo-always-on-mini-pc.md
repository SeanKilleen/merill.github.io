    <p>
        Vulcan, the company set up by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, will show off its FlipStart
        always-on mobile "mini PC" this week. 
    </p>
    <p>
        FlipStart is a compact 14.8 x 10.1 x 2.6cm (5.8 x 4 x 1in) notebook that sports an
        unnamed 1GHz processor and runs Windows XP. Vulcan's idea is to offer a machine that
        has the compatibility, power and application base of the mainstream Microsoft OS with
        a form factor that's little bigger than a PDA yet features a full QWERTY keyboard.
        Like a PDA, the device is designed to operate continuously, going to sleep when the
        lid is closed rather than shutting down completely. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It weighs under 450g (1lb), Vulcan claims.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike a classic handheld, the FlipStart contains a 30GB hard drive and 256MB of memory.
        The "HDTV-quality" 5.6in 1024 x 600 LCD is driven by an unnamed (again) 3D graphics
        chip with 8MB of video memory. It's got 802.11b/g built-in, and Vulcan plans to offer
        optional Bluetooth and mobile phone network access modules. There's a single USB 2.0
        to allow you to connect an external keyboard or other peripherals. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The notebook's lid features an optional control and display unit to allow users to
        check email, play MP3s or check personal information without having to open up the
        machine.

    </p>
    <p>
        Vulcan isn't saying when the FlipStart will ship or how much it will cost. All it
        will say is that it plans to provide that information sometime later this year.
