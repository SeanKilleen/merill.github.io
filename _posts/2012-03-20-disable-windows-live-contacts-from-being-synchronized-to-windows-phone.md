One very useful Windows Phone feature is that it automatically adds all your Windows Live contacts to your Windows Phone when you sign in. This is all fine and dandy if that's your master contact Â list but for me all of those contacts were carried over from MSN Messenger which I stopped using many years ago.

The most annoying bit is that there is no way to get rid of those contacts. As of WP 7.5 you only have two options either delete all your contacts from Windows Live or change your primary Windows Live ID (which required a hard reset).

There is a third option though and that is to filter out the Windows Live contacts from the People Hub.

To do so go to the People Hub <a style="text-decoration: none" href="http://wamprogram.org"><font color="#555555">Jailbreak iPhone 6</font></a> -&gt; Settings -&gt; Filter -&gt; Uncheck Windows Live

Tada a quick and painless way to remove the Windows Live contacts and keep your address book tidy.
