<p>Quick note out to all you guys that we&rsquo;ve shifted the user group meeting to the Microsoft office at WTC and unfortunately you can only attend if you registered early due to seating issues.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t keep that from holding you back though, feel free to gate crash if you don&rsquo;t mind standing!</p>
<p>Remember: There will be no UG meeting at Gateway, Borella instead at Microsoft, 31st Floor, West Wing, WTC.</p>
