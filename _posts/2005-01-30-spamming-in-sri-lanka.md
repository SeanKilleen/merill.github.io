<p><a href="http://blog.brainwaves.ws/">Kavinda</a> has <a href="http://blog.brainwaves.ws/PermaLink.aspx?guid=14839475-536b-448e-b64d-878b12d53264">blogged</a> about an email thread conversation that took place between a Hameedia Brand Manager and an email recipient called Dinesh (Kavinda, who is he?) after Hameedia decided to spam him with marketing mails. Dinesh does have a point that in Sri Lanka for dial up users it does cost money to spend time downloading spam mails.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use any local ISPs, but do any of them provide server based spam filters?</p>
