        This guy&#160;working at IFS has done a really <a href="http://www.geocities.com/waidyah/BUSROUTEMAP.HTM">neat
        job</a> of showing the bus routes in the Colombo area.
    </p>

        I wonder how much effort it would take to do one that you could query. Microsoft has
        a product called <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/mappoint/default.asp">MapPoint</a> which
        I think could be reused so that we can just feed in the data and it would generate
        the map and allow it to be queried.
    </p>

        It would be a great thing if some company could create this database. If it is <a href="http://www.mapquest.com">possible</a> to
        do it for a large country like USA, surely it must be easier for Sri Lanka. Is the
        RDA doing something like this? 
    </p>
    <p>
        This would be a good idea for eSri Lanka.
