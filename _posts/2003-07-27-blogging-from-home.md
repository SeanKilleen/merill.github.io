Finally got my machine setup at home. Windows XP gave a weird problem the power went off suddenly and the next time I booted up the machine the it gave an 'Unmountable boot disk error' and I was only able to fix the problem by booting with the Windows XP Setup CD and then running chkdsk as was instructed by the KB article.
