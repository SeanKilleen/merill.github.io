<p>Happy New Year everybody!
</p><p>Looking back, 2006 for me has been a very special year and one that I'm thanking God for blessing me so wonderfully.
</p><p>I got married to the love of my life, nearly ten years after we fell madly in love with each other. I switched jobs to go back to my old company where I absolutely love coming to work in the mornings and I finally bought my very own house.
</p><p>To top off everything, the Lord blessed us with our wonderful son <a href="http://www.joshuaf.net">Joshua</a>!</p>
