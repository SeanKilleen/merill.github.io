<P>Jina just started&nbsp;announcing the five finalists for the <A href="http://thespoke.net/imagine">Imagine Cup ‘06</A> so I guess I can blog about it. The shortlisted teams in no particular order are:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Perfect Sleep &amp; Energetic Wake Up</STRONG> (P Mahanthege, K Jeewantha, B Balasooriya &amp; H Kumara of Colombo University) 
<LI><STRONG>My Plant</STRONG> (Sudesh, Prabath, Amila &amp; Kosala of Colombo University) 
<LI><STRONG>Panchayudha</STRONG> (Yasith, Shanaka, Prasad &amp; Chathurika of Moratuwa University) 
<LI><STRONG>Smart Buddy</STRONG> (D Abeywickrama, J Liyanaarachchi, K Peiris &amp; D Perera of Colombo University) 
<LI><STRONG>Amity</STRONG> (Y Hettiarachchi, J Liyanapathirana, K Karunanayake &amp; G Perera of Colombo University)</LI></UL>
<P>Congralutions guys! So what happens next is that each team will be assigned a mentor (one of the MVPs) and then each&nbsp;finalist will present their entry at the grand final which will be held on the 31st of May. There’s going to be a&nbsp;whole&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;tension and excitement since the presentations will be live in front of the judges as well&nbsp;as&nbsp;all the invitees and the winning entry will be announced immediately.</P>
<P>I also need to congratulate all the other teams that sent in entries as well, believe it or not, you too are a winner for the simple fact that you did compete.</P>
