<p>Schneier reports that <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/sha1_broken.html">SHA-1 has been broken</a>. <em>&lsquo;SHA-1 has been broken. Not a reduced-round version. Not a simplified version. The real thing.&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>Time to revisit all the applications you&rsquo;ve written that used SHA-1!</p>
