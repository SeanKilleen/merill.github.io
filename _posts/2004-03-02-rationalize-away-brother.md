            hackers for their pathetic user-interfaces: "This kind of fecklessness [in UI design]
            is endemic in open-source land. And it's what's keeping Microsoft in business &mdash;
            because by Goddess, they may write crappy insecure overpriced shoddy software, but
            on this one issue their half-assed semi-competent best is an order of magnitude better

            One thing we (Microsoft) have on them (Eric Raymond and friends) is that we&#160;write
            software people actually buy. Hell, in their case they find it hard to give it away.
