<p>I finally managed to connect to the internet from home today. The dial-up line that I&rsquo;m connecting from though is excruciatingly, painfully slow and keeps disconnecting frequently. </p>
<p>The good news is I&rsquo;m going to be a &lsquo;new home owner&rsquo; soon and thankfully SLT provides ADSL to Thalawathugoda.</p>
<p>What this all means though is that I&rsquo;ll be able to blog more often in the future.</p>
