    Retired Sri Lankan cricket captain Arjuna Ranatunga hit back at his running adversary
    Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne saying he (Ranatunga) would rather put on weight
    than take drugs to prove his fitness.<br />
    "Arjuna, he's probably slotting himself around at 150 kilos (kilograms, 330 pounds)
    at the moment, is he? Swallowed a sheep or something like that", Warne was quoted
    as saying by the international news agency AFP on Saturday.<br />
    "If I swallow a lamb or a goat, it is none of his (Warne's) business," Ranatunga was
    quoted by the AP news agency in reply on the same day.<br />
    "But I must tell him that I don't swallow those pills and blame my mother for it,"
    Ranatunga added, making an obvious reference to Warne's positive test for a banned
    diuretic which resulted in a one year ban for the spinner.<br />
    "It is better to swallow a sheep or a goat than swallow what he has been swallowing,"
    Ranatunga was further quoted as saying. "I am fine and fit at 95 kilograms (209 pounds)".<br />
    Warne is expected to arrive in Sri Lanka on Friday for his first international assignment
    after being tested positive for the banned substance on January 22 last year.<br />
    "I am certainly going to meet him," Ranatunga said and jokingly added: "I may even
    invite him to attend one of my campaign meetings. Though I know I may risk losing
    some votes". Ranatunga is contesting for a parliamentary seat at Sri Lanka's general
    election on April 2.<br />
    The verbal tirade between the two however had not stopped Ranatunga from admiring
    Warne's ability as a player. "I, however, respect Warne as a player. He is great",
    Ranatunga had admitted. [<a href="http://www.dailymirror.lk/2004/02/23/sports/1.asp">Daily
