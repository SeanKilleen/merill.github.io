            PrimoPDF is a free tool for high-quality PDF creation. With a user-friendly interface
            that enables “printing” to PDF from virtually any Windows® application, PrimoPDF also
            offers users the ability to optimize PDF output for printing to standard laser printers
            or for onscreen viewing. The product is completely free - not just a trial – eliminating
            cost barriers for those users requiring basic creation of high-quality PDF files.
