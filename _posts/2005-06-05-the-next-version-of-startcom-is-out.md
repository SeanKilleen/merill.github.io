<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The next version of MSN's experimental RSS reader is available at <a href="http://www.start.com/3"><font color="#355ea0">http://www.start.com/3</font></a>. You have to solve the questions before getting access to the next version of the site but once that's done you get access to the juicy goodness. </p>
