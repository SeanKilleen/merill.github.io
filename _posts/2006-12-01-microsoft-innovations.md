<p><a href="http://scobleizer.com/2006/12/01/is-microsoft-innovative-dave-winer-and-i-argue-it-out/">Is Microsoft Innovative?</a> A fun debate between Robert Scoble and Dave Winer on the Wall Street Journal online.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s even more interesting is this comment left by a guy called Stan on Scobles blog.</p>
<p><em>Winer is either completely ignorant or is just playing the &ldquo;MS just copies&rdquo; role for effect.</em></p>
<p><em>Here are some MS innovations off the top of my head (some big, some small, some built on top of previous work, but lots of &ldquo;innovations&rdquo; in tech build on previous work):<br />* AJAX<br />* Web browser component usable by any app<br />* OLE<br />* Spreadsheet Pivot Tables<br />* Tabbed spreadheets (since then, copied by other apps such as browsers)<br />* On-the-fly spell check in word processors<br />* LINQ (the upcoming tech that will be in C# 3.0 and VB9)<br />* Video codec innovations that have led to VC-1 being the premier codec for HD-DVD and BR discs.<br />* Mouse scroll wheels<br />* Mouse GoForward/GoBack buttons<br />* Ergonomic mice (I recall the days where you had to press down on a mouse while moving it in order to move the cursor; Microsoft ended that nonsense).<br />* Ergonomic keyboards<br />* Office 2007 UI<br />* Mac Office floating palette UI<br />* TerraServer (precursor of Virtual Earth, NASA WorldWind, Google Earth)<br />* Ability to alter compiled code while debugging it<br />* User Agents<br />* Wizards<br />* Intellisense<br />* Answer Wizard technology in Office Help<br />* ClearType<br />* TrueType (collaboration with Apple)<br />* Bob (yeah, it failed in the marketplace, but it was innovative (too much for its own good))<br />* Dynamic HTML desktops<br />* Taskbar<br />* Alt-Tab to switch apps<br />* Lots of small innovations in .NET that when combined equal large cumulative innovation.<br />* ActiveX (yes, it had security issues, particularly before XP SP2, but is great in an intranet setting)<br />* Net-DDE, the first tech to allow clipboard functionality over LAN<br />* Singularity<br />* Combining the Back and Forward history buttons into one navigation stack control in IE7<br />* Photosynth<br />* XPS (does everything that PDF does, adds graphical effects that PDF lacks, does it in a smaller file size, and does it using XML so the files can be manipulated via XML parsers)<br />* Windows Live Contacts (being developed by Danny Thorpe (legendary programmer at Borland, who jumped to Google, then 4 months later went to Microsoft))<br />* A bunch of little stuff in IM via MSN Messenger<br />* OneNote (I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any other app really like it (and those that try to be like it aren&rsquo;t anywhere near as good), particuarly when used on a Tablet PC)<br />* Mac Word 2004&rsquo;s notebook layout and microphone support<br />* Zune&rsquo;s WiFi (yes, the RIAA only allowed 3play/3day sharing, but its use will grow into other areas)<br />* First console to have a harddrive (Xbox)<br />* Browser runs in a sandbox (IE7 on Vista)<br />* First browser with anti-phishing tech<br />* Multi-core/CPU calculations in Excel 2007<br />* XNA<br />* Vista&rsquo;s ability to allow the user to increase RAM simply by plugging in a USB 2.0 flash drive<br />* First OS to support delayed clipboard rendering<br />* First OS to have a 3D Sound api for games<br />* Shadow Copy<br />* Media Center Extenders (which iTV looks to be a copy of) </em></p>
