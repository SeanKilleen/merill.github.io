            At the RSA Conference 2004 Internet security conference in San Francisco yesterday,
            Microsoft Chairman and Chief Software Architect Bill Gates outlined his company's
            plans to work with large email partners to eliminate spam. Gates said Microsoft will
            give those partners free technology that will emulate the caller ID functionality
            in today's telephone systems and prevent spammers from hiding their identities and
            forwarding mail through anonymous sources. The plan, which involves backers such as
            Amazon.com, Brightmail, and Sendmail and calls for a global registry of legitimate
            Internet email sources, might have to compete with similar but less sophisticated
            initiatives in the works at Yahoo! and AOL. Microsoft correctly notes, however, that
            for the scheme to work, a large number of email providers must adopt it.

            Microsoft's antispam effort, the Coordinated Spam Reduction Initiative (CSRI), will
            include numerous policies and technologies that the company will use to curb the spam
            threat. Microsoft is working to establish standards that will help legitimate email
            senders differentiate themselves from spammers, developing new email filters, and
            working on a micropayment system that would make spam financially ineffective. "Spam
            is our email customers' number-one complaint today, and Microsoft is innovating on
            many different fronts to eradicate it,"
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            Gates said. "We believe that Caller ID for E-Mail and the Coordinated Spam Reduction
            Initiative will help change the economic model for sending spam and put spammers out
            of business."
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            Ryan Hamlin, general manager for Microsoft's Anti-Spam Technology and Strategy Group,
            describes caller ID as a mechanism that legitimate senders of email can use to help
            ensure that spammers aren't abusing their Internet domains. "In a nutshell, caller
            ID involves two key steps," he said. "One, senders of email publish the IP addresses
            of their outgoing mail servers in DNS in an email-policy document. Two, the email
            software at the receiving end of a message queries DNS for the email policy and determines
            the 'purported responsible domain' of the message. This is done by comparing the information
            in DNS to ensure it matches the information on the originating mail. We believe this
            technical solution gets at the root of the spam problem by helping to confirm legitimate
            senders."

        <p class="MsoNormal">
            By this summer, Microsoft will roll out a beta version of Caller ID for E-Mail in
            MSN Hotmail to test its effectiveness. Hotmail currently serves more than 150 million
            active email users and is the most-used email service on the planet. Microsoft will
            also work with partners to ensure that the system is in place on as many email ISPs
            as possible and help develop a compliance program. The company is also working on
            viable-identification alternatives for smaller email senders and says it will continue
            to work on other antispam technologies, including challenge-response systems, machine
            learning, micropayments, and safelists. [<a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/">WinSuperSite</a>]
