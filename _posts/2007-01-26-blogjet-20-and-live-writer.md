<p><a href="http://blogjet.com/">BlogJet</a> 2.0 has been released. I&rsquo;ve tried it out but I think I&rsquo;m going to give it a pass and stick to the old version. </p>
<p>IMO <a href="http://blogjet.com/">BlogJet</a> 2.0 suffers from the same problem as <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/">Windows Live Writer</a>, the key word here being &lsquo;clunky&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Hmm.. Just checked out the <a href="http://gallery.live.com/default.aspx?l=8">Live Writer Gallery</a>,&nbsp;looks like the Live Writer team&nbsp;has been busy updating it with six new releases and there&rsquo;s a thriving gallery of Writer Extensions. Will report back soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime you can download Live Writer from <a href="http://g.msn.com/8SEENUS030000TBR/WriterMSI">here</a>.</p>
