            "In the wake of the MyDoom/NovaRG fiasco, every Mac columnist has an easy out. After
            yet another virus attack has hammered the Windows world, the automatic response has
            been to pen the standard Mac gloat. It goes something like this: I didn't get this
            virus because I have a Mac. In fact, I never get viruses. Never have, never will.
            That's because Mac software is simply better than Windows software. So there....

            game changed for Apple</a> when it upgraded from OS 9's fairly unique operating system
            to the Unix-based OS X. That meant any attack aimed at Unix machines could affect
            Macs. And plenty of virus and worm attacks have been aimed at Unix.

            In short, now that Apple has Unix under the hood, Steve Jobs can't rely on security
            through obscurity. The argument that Apple is safer because of its marginal place
            in computing's cosmos no longer applies. With its embrace of Unix, Apple has joined
            a big family -- and it keeps growing, thanks to Linux and other open-source versions
            of Unix."
