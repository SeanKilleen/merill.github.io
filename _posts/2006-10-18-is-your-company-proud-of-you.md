<p>James Governor,&nbsp;an analyst. <a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/archives/002376.html">talks</a> about how the WS02 guys cherish their <a href="http://www.wso2.com/about/engineering/">developers</a>. </p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>What a nice change from the norm- where corporate web sites only have bios for the most <a href="http://www.wso2.com/about/management/">senior execs</a>. We'll be keeping an eye out for more about pages citing devs. Can you suggest any?</p>
<p>It shows guts to provide email addresses and links for to one of your most valuable resources - developers. But these days if you don't turn your colleagues into stars someone else will. </p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">I can remember when I once interviewed at <a href="http://www.virtusa.com/">Virtusa</a>, Keith Modder,&nbsp;an MD there, said something&nbsp;which went a long way to impress on me how much they valued their engineers. To paraphrase him &ldquo;Everday at 5.00pm when the guys leave work, the value of this company goes down to $0. Bottom line we know our priorities.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Talking of WS02, it&rsquo;s&nbsp; good to see the faces of some of the guys I&rsquo;ve had an opportunity to work with in the past including Thilina, Ruwan, Ishan and <a href="http://www.itambalama.com/">Chamil</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">BTW: Chamil, you need to fix the link to IT Ambalama from your profile.</p>
