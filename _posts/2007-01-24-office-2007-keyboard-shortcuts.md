<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Office 2007 for the past six months but its just today that I ran into the awesome keyboard shortcut.</p>
<p>Man, the Office&nbsp;guys have really pulled a rabbit out of the hat with this one and I can shoot myself for not figuring this out earlier.</p>
<p>What it boils down to is that every icon in the ribbon/toolbar has a keyboard shortcut and you can get it to with a few keystrokes WITHOUT HAVING TO REMEMBER ANYTHING! Whoooooooooooooo.</p>
<p>Just press Alt and start typing in the characters that start showing up on the toolbars to get to your icon.</p>
<p>For example to do a &lsquo;Paste Special&rsquo; (which I keep doing a lot) you just need to type in ALT, H, V, S. Perfect!</p>
