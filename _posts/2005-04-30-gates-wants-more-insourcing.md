<p><em>Microsoft Chairman and Chief Software Architect Bill Gates is asking the US government to let more foreign citizens work at US corporations. <br />Gates says that current work visa limits are preventing skilled workers from coming to the United States--costing the country its lead in computer science and other industries. "This is almost a case of a centrally controlled economy," Gates said yesterday at the Library of Congress. "If the demand is there, why have the regulation at all?" Congress placed a cap on the issuance of work visas in the name of security and to protect jobs for US citizens. But the limits have reduced the number of workers coming into this country each year from 195,000 to 65,000 workers. "We're just not seeing an available labor pool," Gates added.
