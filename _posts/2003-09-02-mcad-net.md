    <p>
        Passed the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/traincert/exams/70-320.asp">70-320</a> exam
        on Developing XML Web Services and Server Components with Microsoft Visual C# today.
        My score for this exam was 966/1000 which meant that I had got two questions wrong
        out of the fifty seven.
