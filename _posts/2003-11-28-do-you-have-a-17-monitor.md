            I&rsquo;ve been using 17&rdquo; monitors for over three years but it&rsquo;s always
            been on a resolution of 1024x768. The day before I read an article where a guy was
            talking of a higher resolution so I decided to try the 1152x864 and boy have I been
            missing some real estate on my screen. Now I can see much more code in Visual Studio.
