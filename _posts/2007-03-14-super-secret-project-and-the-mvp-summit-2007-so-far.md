<P>I just got back from the session by <A href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/">Don</A>&nbsp;and <A href="http://www.simplegeek.com">ChrisAn</A> and they did 'partially' talk about the super secret project they've been working on.</P>
<P>I've captured the whole session on video and will have them up once I get it cleared.</P>
<P>The MVP Summit has so far been 'wicked'. I've met some of the biggest legends who have created the world that I live in and pays for me. BillG started off with his keynote, followed by <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/">Soma</A> and then <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg">Anders </A>took us through all the crazy stuff in C# 3.0 with Don and ChrisAn finishing off what has been a great day.</P>
<P>Tomorrow, I can't wait to meet <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/">ScottGu</A>!</P>
