<p>Wohoo. Guidance Explorer has gone online at <a href="http://www.guidancelibrary.com/GuidanceExplorerBeta/">http://www.guidancelibrary.com/GuidanceExplorerBeta/</a>. This is the first smart client that I&rsquo;m happy has turned into a website. I can now always get the latest stuff by browsing to this page instead of going through the hassle of downloading the latest client and guidance.</p>
<p>Now, if only I could sign in to the system and create my own custom views&hellip;</p>
<p>Congrats to the Guidance Explorer <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/CodeGallery.aspx?id=bb9aecfe-56ba-4ca9-8127-44e551b90962">team</a>! </p>
