<p>Wow. I just remembered that I had a blog.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been quite busy the last three to four weeks putting some of my personal development items in place. The biggest changes has been inspired by a combination of reading <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog">Steve Pavlina</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0671708635?v=glance">The Seven Habits</a> and <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">Getting Things Done</a>.</p>
<p>I now sleep only 6.5 hours a day, wake up at 5 am, head over to the cricket grounds at Tamil Union. At the grounds I&rsquo;m joined by <a href="http://www.kavinda.net/">Kavinda</a> and Wansika, we jog about five rounds around the ground and do another five with a brisk walk. Next we hit the showers and I then do a quick 20 laps at the pool before coming back to office by around 8.00&ndash;8.30 am.</p>
<p>And boy does it really energise your day. My best part of the&nbsp;morning is the cool feel of the wet grass under my feet and&nbsp;listening to the early morning sounds of the chirping birds. I&rsquo;ll try to post a few pics sometime soon.</p>
<p>My memberships fees to join Tamil Union has been one of the best investments I&rsquo;ve made in my life. I just spent Rs. 6,500/&ndash; to become a club member which included a Rs. 3000/&ndash; joining fee. </p>
