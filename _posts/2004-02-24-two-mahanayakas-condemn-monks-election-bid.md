            The country&rsquo;s top two Buddhist prelates yesterday condemned the decision by
            a section of Buddhist monks to contest in the forthcoming general election.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            In a joint statement, the Most Venerable Rambukwelle Sri Vipassi Maha Nayaka thera
            and the Most Venerable Udugama Sri Buddharakkitha Maha Nayaka thera said, &ldquo;It
            had been said in the media that Bhikkus are going to contest the forthcoming general
            election citing various reasons.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            &ldquo;This is the beginning of a grave calamity to the Buddha Sasana. Therefore for
            no reason can this be approved. Both the clergy and the laity who are concerned about
            the Sasana are astonished by this move. They are distressed.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            &ldquo;When considering the historical background it is clear that Bhikkus have served
            as advisors and mentors to those who governed while attending to the spiritual needs
            of the people.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            &ldquo;Therefore the responsibility of the Bhikkus is to act in an advisory capacity
            as aforesaid,&rdquo; the two prelates stated. [<a href="http://www.colombopage.com/archive/February2353325UN.html">ColomboPage</a>]
