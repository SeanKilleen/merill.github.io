<p>Wow. Now this is a major boost to the Windows Mobile platform.</p>
<p><strong>On the go:</strong> Microsoft will give away software upgrades to provide Outlook users access to wireless corporate e-mail on mobile devices, in a move that could unseat the mobile e-mail leader, Research in Motion's BlackBerry.</p>
<p>The free upgrades for Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 and Windows Mobile 5.0 will lift business e-mail and other Outlook data from corporate computers, and automatically send it to mobile phones running on Microsoft Windows software.</p>
<p>It took Research in Motion seven years to win over 2 million customers, and with one swoop Microsoft will give more than 130 million Outlook users the option to access their business e-mail on the go. Microsoft hopes the move will convince corporations to buy mobile devices running on Windows. [Source: Wired News]</p>
