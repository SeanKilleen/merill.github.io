            Ian Griffiths has an excellent article on WinFX (the managed API for Longhorn). It
            also gives you a clear insight into the future of .NET and why we all will be ultimately
            developing using .NET. If you don&rsquo;t know what WinFX is then read this. [<a href="http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2003/11/24/longhorn_01.htm">Read
