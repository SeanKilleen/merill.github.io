<P>Microsoft gives us MVPs with a $150 voucher that we could use to buy anything we want at the Microsoft Company Store. Unfortunately I have a feeling that they only provide a subset of the items available at the store to us. I could hardly find anything to buy and finally settled on a Optical Desktop (which I love) and some really useless stuff like caps, flasks and an umbrella. I would have loved to have purchased an XBox if it was available. </P>
<P>But what I'm really pissed off with is the Sri Lankan customs officials and UPS. I had to shell out $35 as duty and other taxes for the $150 worth of items that I ordered. I was speaking with the UPS guy and he said the government had added an additional 3% tax after the tsunami for all imports. I wouldn't mind if they did anything remotely useful with this money but it would ultimately end up in some politicians pocket. </P>
<P>The fact is that the only thing of value in the pack I got from Microsoft was the optical desktop which cost $50 and I had to pay $35 as duty. WTF. Had I known this earlier I would have simply tossed away the voucher and not ordered anything at all. Not that any of this is Microsoft's fault though.</P>
