            Microsoft is giving away SFU (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/sfu/">Services
            For Unix</a>) free of charge (this was earlier charged $99). SFU was awards Best of
            Breed last year for programs under the Unix category. If you work in the mixed Linux/Unix
            + Windows network environment and haven&rsquo;t heard of SFU (which would be very
            hard to believe) you&rsquo;re really missing out.
