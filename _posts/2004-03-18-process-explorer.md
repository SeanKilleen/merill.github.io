            Ever wondered which program has a particular file or directory open? Now you can find
            out. Process Explorer shows you information about which handles and DLLs processes
            have opened or loaded.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            The Process Explorer display consists of two sub-windows. The top window always shows
            a list of the currently active processes, including the names of their owning accounts,
            whereas the information displayed in the bottom window depends on the mode that Process
            Explorer is in: if it is in handle mode you&rsquo;ll see the handles that the process
            selected in the top window has opened; if Process Explorer is in DLL mode you&rsquo;ll
            see the DLLs and memory-mapped files that the process has loaded. Process Explorer
            also has a powerful search capability that will quickly show you which processes have
            particular handles opened or DLLs loaded.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            The unique capabilities of Process Explorer make it useful for tracking down DLL-version
            problems or handle leaks, and provide insight into the way Windows and applications
            work. &#160;[<a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/procexp.shtml">Free
