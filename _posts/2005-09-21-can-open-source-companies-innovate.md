<p>Ever since I attended the FOSS conference a couple of weeks ago, I've been 
trying to figure out how viable an option Open Source is for the software 
industry as well as developing countries like ours.</p>
<p>Every trail of thought that I could think of led to the same place and 
today's <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/columnists/neil_mcallister.html">Open 
Enterprise</a> column on InfoWorld nails it. The answer is: <em>"Without 
licensing fees to fall back on, pure open source companies may be limited to 
imitating proprietary vendors' successes".</em></p>
<p>Now that everyone has seen how Microsoft is innovating in the next versions 
of Vista, Office, .NET (Linq) it definitely proves Neil's theory:</p>
<p><em>Let's say this is the shape of the software industry for the next 10 
years. A proprietary company comes up with an innovative idea and it's 
successful. The open source community scrambles to duplicate this idea. 
Eventually the open source version matures, it catches on, the product category 
becomes commoditized, and customers gravitate toward the lowest-cost option. 
Meanwhile, a new innovative idea has come along. Rinse, repeat. </em></p>
<p><em>Bill Gates told CNet, "The industry will always be a mix of free and 
commercial software." If he's finally fine with that, is it good enough for us, 
too?</em> </p>
