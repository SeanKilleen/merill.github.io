    <p>
        Charles Carrol of <a href="http://www.learnasp.com">LearnASP</a> has released a <a href="http://www.learnasp.com/freebook/learn/index.aspx">free
        book</a> on ASP.NET. This is a really good starting place for anyone learning the
        ropes.

    <p>
        I can remember when I frequently visited LearnASP.com for the quick tutorials when
        I first started working on ASP at <a href="http://www.lanka.com">Lanka Online</a> in
        '99.
