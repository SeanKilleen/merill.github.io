<p>A lot of you guys already know that I left Microsoft Sri Lanka after being on the job for just five&nbsp;months. The big question everyone wants to know is. Why?</p>
<p>This quote from the the classic&nbsp;Mythical Man Month says it all: <em>The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures. </em></p>
<p>Do I regret joining Microsoft? No. It was truly a great experience. I got to work with some really great people, was involved in some of the really cool stuff that happened in Sri Lanka like Tech.Ed 2005, Visual Studio launch, Imagine Cup 2006 and a number of other smaller things.</p>
<p>What do I do now? Well I&rsquo;ve joined <a href="http://www.assette.com/">Assette</a> (formerly BTA) again. My boss was really wonderful about taking me back and I&rsquo;m super charged about the exciting stuff that we&rsquo;re working on. Would you believe that we&rsquo;ve already moved on to SQL Server 2005?</p>
<p>So expect to see and hear more from me.</p>
