<p>The guys over at LinuxAdvocate.org have a slightly biased &lsquo;Plain English&rsquo; translation of the legalise in the Windows XP EULA. Many of us have clicked on the &lsquo;I Agree&rsquo; button without really understanding them but given that they are non-binding, I guess it doesn&rsquo;t matter what&nbsp;**** they have in there.</p>
<p>Makes for interesting reading: <a href="http://www.linuxadvocate.org/articles.php?p=1">http://www.linuxadvocate.org/articles.php?p=1</a></p>
<p>The funniest part, as mentioned in a recent&nbsp;InfoWorld, is this translation:</p>
<p><em>Microsoft is not liable even if they break the terms of this agreement.</em></p>
