<p>Google Reader got a fresh update today and the experience is nearly as good as my favorite offline reader, RssBandit. It even works on my slow dial-up line from home. Bloglines and Newsgator on the other hand choked and fell flat on the floor!
</p><p>By the way, I'm blogging this from Word 2007 and it feels super good, what the spell and grammar checking and the natural feel to writing documents. I love it.
</p><p>Configuring it was pretty straight-forward. If you're using dasBlog just make sure that the url is set to http://&lt;site url&gt;/blogger.aspx.</p>
