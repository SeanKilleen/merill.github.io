            Never thought this was possible.

            In possibly the best news web designers will hear this year, Joe Maddalone of <a href="http://www.insert-title.com/" title="linky love">Insert
            Title Web Designs</a> has discovered a way of running <a href="http://www.insert-title.com/web_design/?page=articles/dev/multi_IE" title="http://www.insert-title.com/web_design/?page=articles/dev/multi_IE">multiple
            versions of Internet Explorer</a> on one installation of Windows! The problem of testing
            in different versions of <acronym>IE</acronym> has plagued developers for years, and
            it's fantastic to see a solution that doesn't involve running multiple partitions
            with separate Windows installations or shelling out for VMWare or VirtualPC.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unsurprisingly, Joe's revelation is causing quite a stir in the web development community.
            Matthew Haughey is <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/archives.blah/007561" title="Designer makes IE developer-friendly">asking</a> why
            Microsoft didn't tell us about this themselves, Luke Redpath has <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2003/11/06/ie_x_3/#c002232" title="In a comment on mezzoblue.com">released</a> some <a href="http://www.sonicdeath.co.uk/stuff/ie-multiple-icons.zip" title="Zip File">funky
            coloured icons</a> to distinguish between versions and Ryan Parman has taken the risky
            (from a bandwidth point of view) step of <a href="http://www.skyzyx.com/archives/000094.php" title="Multiple Versions of Internet Explorer">packaging
            the minimum files</a> needed to run versions 5.01 and 5.5 up in to zip files. Amazingly,
            they're 2.92 MB and 3.25 MB respectively. I'm running them now and they seem to work
            just fine - major kudos to Joe for the discovery, and Ryan for making it so easy to
            take advantage of.
