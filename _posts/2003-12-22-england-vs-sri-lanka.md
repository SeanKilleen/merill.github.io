            Hareendra (Pala) and I went to watch the final England Vs Sri Lanka Test match at
            SSC on the last two days. Shasheendra joined us after lunch on the last day and we
            had a blast watching Sri Lanka give England a good beating. There was never a dull
            moment with the Barmy Army keeping us entertained. And we got to see something (not
            cricket) that you guys who weren&rsquo;t there missed (check out <a href="http://www.manjeeva.net/">Manjeeva&rsquo;s
            site</a> under comments to get a clue).

            Kudos to Murali for his Man of the Series performance and getting ever closer towards
            breaking Courtney Walsh&rsquo;s record of most test wickets.
