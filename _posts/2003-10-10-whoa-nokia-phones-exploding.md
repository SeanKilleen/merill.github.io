        You guys using Nokia phones with non-Nokia batteries watchout. A <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/68/32462.html">woman
        from Netherlands</a> was injured less than three months ago in an explosion and recently
        there has been news about one in <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/68/33305.html">Holland</a> and
        another one in <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/68/33309.html">Vietnam</a>.

        We in Sri Lanka better watch out. Let alone the battery, do you know if your phone
        is an original Nokia in the first place!

        I for one have already started taking precautionary action and as a result will be
        keeping my distance from Madura.
