<p>That's right folks, I've taken the <a href="http://www.arrod.co.uk/essays/matrix.php">Red Pill</a> and boy does it 
feel good. Although I've been here for just one day, I'm mightily impressed with 
how things are organised. It's turning out to be fun, exciting and 
exhilarating!</p>
<p>My role here at Microsoft is, as a Developer Evangelist&nbsp;and one of the 
first projects that I'm working on is Tech Ed, Sri Lanka. This event is going to 
be BIG with a whole heap of exciting stuff planned for. We're getting down over 
15 world class speakers the likes this island has never seen before and I'm 
pretty sure that we're going to be all sold out before the event 
starts.</p>
