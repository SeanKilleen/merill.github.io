            My apologies for not posting the past few days, the main reason was the NewsGator
            died on me and crashed Outlook each time I opened it. So clever Outlook asked me whether
            it should disable the add-in and I said yes. After that I was too lazy to figure out
            how to enable it again until today, so I tried re-installing but that didn&rsquo;t
            seem to work. That&rsquo;s when I did a Google search and came up with this tip. To
            enable a disabled Outlook Add-in go to Help -&gt; About -&gt; Disabled Items and presto
            you&rsquo;ve got your man there!
