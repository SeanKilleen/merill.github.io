<p></p>The very first posting to this blog from a Linux box! The lab
that I'm lecturing on .NET Compact Framework development for an
Advanced MSc batch has all these dual boot boxes with Ubuntu and XP, so
I thought I'd give it a go.<br>
The text is crystal clear, even much more better than an XP box with ClearType turned on.<br>
Hmm... maybe I should run Ubuntu on the box I have at home.<br>
