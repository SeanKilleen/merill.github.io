<p>With AOL&rsquo;s announcement of their 2GB free email service here&rsquo;s a current snapshot of the big guys:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gmail &ndash; 2.3 GB</li>
<li>AOL &ndash; 2 GB</li>
<li>Yahoo &ndash; 1 GB</li>
<li>Hotmail &ndash; 250 MB</li></ul>
<p>I wonder what the guys at MSN are up to. With all the MSN Spaces, photos&nbsp;and all other features that they provide, they definitely must be having something up their sleeves.</p>
