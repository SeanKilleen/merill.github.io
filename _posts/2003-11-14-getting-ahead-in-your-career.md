            Franklins.Net Sales Weasel Todd Follansbee has come up with what I think is a great&#160;read
            for all developers, and .NET developers in particular.&#160; This can be found online

            You might question if .NET will help you financially. Here is a recent quote from <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/careertopics/careers/story/0,,86408,00.html" title="http://www.computerworld.com/careertopics/careers/story/0,,86408,00.html">Computer

            &#160;&ldquo;&hellip; there are certain IT skills for which companies are willing
            to pay a premium right now. On the technical side, .Net experience is perhaps the
            hottest skill, with network security experience running a close second&rdquo;&#160;
