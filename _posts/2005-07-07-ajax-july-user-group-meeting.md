<p>As promised at the user group meeting yesterday here are the slides and the link to the Ajax .NET library.</p>
<p>Download: <a href="http://www.merill.net/wp-content/uploads/contentbinary/AJAX.zip">Ajax - Presentation</a></p>
<p>Ajax.NET Library: <a href="http://ajax.schwarz-interactive.de/csharpsample/default.aspx">http://ajax.schwarz-interactive.de/csharpsample/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>I hope all of you enjoyed the presentation as much as I did and I need to apoligize for the demo cock up that happened. I would appreciate any feedback that you can give as well as answer any questions that you may have regarding the Ajax library.</p>
