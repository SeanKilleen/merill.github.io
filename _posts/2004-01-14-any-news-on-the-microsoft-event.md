            I wasn&rsquo;t able to go for the Microsoft Event over here in Colombo the other day
            due to two reasons. The first was that even though I registered on the site I never
            got an invitation, Jinath from <a href="http://www.teamwork.se/">Teamwork</a> told
            me that he too registered on the site but didn&rsquo;t get one although one of his
            colleagues had got an invitation for the event so go figure. Secondly I had some other
            work and didn&rsquo;t have time (or was too lazy!) to call up the organizers to get
            an invitation, I&rsquo;m sure they would have gladly obliged. But the point is that
            Microsoft India needs to do a better job of organizing these, they should have at
            the least notified their <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/partner">Partners</a>.

            Anyway enough of my ranting, the reason I posted was to find out if any of you went
            to the event, if so let us know how it went.
