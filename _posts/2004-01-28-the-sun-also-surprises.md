            Sun calls its Java Desktop System "the first viable Microsoft Windows alternative,"
            but it&rsquo;s apparently much more than that. One crew member trying out Sun&rsquo;s
            bootable JDS evaluation disc made an intriguing discovery: You can insert the Linux-based
            disc into any NTFS (NT file system), boot up, and bypass Windows security to gain
            access to all the files on the hard drive (kids, please don&rsquo;t try this at home).
            It&rsquo;s an open source OS and an anti-Microsoft hacking tool all in one -- what
            more could a geek want?
