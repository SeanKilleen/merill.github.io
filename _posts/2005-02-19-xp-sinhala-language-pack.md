<P><A href="http://jinath.weblogs.us">Jinath</A> has posted some <A href="http://jinath.weblogs.us/archives/025370.html">screenshots</A> of Windows and a Google page with the Sinhala Language Pack installed. Microsoft released the beta version of the Sinhala Language Pack to be used in the Tsunami aid programs.&nbsp;We&nbsp;MVP's got a beta copy as well to test out and provide feedback on. Hmm... I'll need to learn to read Sinhalese first before I can give any feedback though.</P>
