        <p>
            I just got an idea reading this <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/wiredmag/1,2167,61735,00.html">piece</a> on
            Wired News on how Howard Dean was able to use the power of social networks to build
            his campaign for the presidency. My idea is to build a portal that all Sri Lankan&rsquo;s
            can visit, one that is vibrant and appealing to the masses, but also one that is contributed
            and maintained by the masses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Confused? Let me explain. I want to build a basic framework for a portal and then
            delegate various sections (Entertainment, Politics, Music, Drama, Theatre, etc) to
            anyone willing to contribute. We could have a News section where anyone can post news
            articles once it grows big news could be localized by city and the latest news would
            be on our site because we&rsquo;ll have the power of the people.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I&rsquo;ll need to get started I need to think of a name, register a domain, decide
            where to host? If we do this right we&rsquo;re going to have a big impact on the media
            in Sri Lanka!
