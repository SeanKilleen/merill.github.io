        Microsoft to the rescue? A marketing weasel came by and asked me to fix a dead notebook,
        as if I'm his personal geek slave.

        I said his machine was probably compromised by the Internet Explorer HTML converter
        flaw Microsoft announced last week, which lets malicious Web code take over your PC.
        Was he, by chance, visiting sites he shouldn't have been? "Lemme just check the log
        files for your IP address," I said. He looked like he'd swallowed an Ethernet dongle.
        "That's OK," he squeaked, "I'll fix it myself."
