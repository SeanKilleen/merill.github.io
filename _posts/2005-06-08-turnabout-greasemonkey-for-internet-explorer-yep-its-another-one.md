<p>For those of you who installed Trixie after reading my earlier post, you should now really look into <a href="http://www.reifysoft.com/turnabout.php">Turnabout</a>, one of the key reasons being that the developer of Trixie has stopped work on it. See <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=dde5716b-a7d5-4bd3-8193-7aea84cb67d5">Dare&rsquo;s post</a> for the low down.</p>
