        Have you ever spent time explaining the steps to perform an action and wished you
        could just show it to them instead.

        Microsoft gives you a free&#160;tool to do this. Download the Windows Media Encoder
        from the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/9series/encoder/default.aspx">Windows
        Media</a> site and simply start a recording session and then perform the steps. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The resulting file is really small that you could easily mail it out.

        Now I know how I'll be creating support How To content for our products, enough with
        the documentation!
