            "Moscow's medical workers <a href="http://english.pravda.ru/science/19/94/377/11797_phenomenon.html" title="http://english.pravda.ru/science/19/94/377/11797_phenomenon.html">discovered
            a magnificent gift</a> of a sixteen-year-old girl Natalya Demkina from Saransk. The
            girl possesses "dual vision". She is capable of discerning a person's internal organs
            without using X-ray or ultrasound. Natasha has already disproved several medical diagnoses
            and has not made any mistakes. A series of medical experiments conducted in one of
            the clinics provide substantial and undeniable proofs of the girls' unique abilities."<br />
