        <p>
            I read somewhere that <a href="http://www.billingsgazette.com/index.php?id=1&amp;display=rednews/2004/01/15/build/nation/25-bushspace.inc" title="http://www.billingsgazette.com/index.php?id=1&amp;display=rednews/2004/01/15/build/nation/25-bushspace.inc">the
            cost of going to Mars may eventually total up to $170 billion</a> which is nowhere
            close to the $12 billion the US President has stated will&#160;flow into&#160;NASA's
            coffers over the next 5 years to help finance the Mars dream.&#160;I don't want to
            knock the US government's spending on AIDS (supposedly <a href="http://www.kff.org/hivaids/6050-index.cfm" title="http://www.kff.org/hivaids/6050-index.cfm">$1
            billion this year</a>)&#160;but aren't there significant, higher priority problems
            on Earth that need tackling before one starts dabbling in interplanterary conquest?
