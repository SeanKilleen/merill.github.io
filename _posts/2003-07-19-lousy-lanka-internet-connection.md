        We are on a 128K leased line with Lanka Internet. All I can say is that it's pretty
        lousy. In the morning the line was fine and I was happily download E2K3 from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/resources/subdwnld.asp">MSDN</a> at
        about 14K but for the past half hour it has been crawling at 3K, this happens pretty
        much often.

        Madura wants us to switch to SLT, we used it at <a href="http://www.globalbsolutions.com">GBS</a>&#160;for
        the last three years with very stable performance.

        Wonder who the best network is in SL?
