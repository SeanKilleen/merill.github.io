<p>I've got a great many videos that I've captured in .wmv but haven't had the time to figure out resolutions, formats and burning them to DVDs, yet.</p> <p>That's all changed now that Lifehacker has a a great post on <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/dvds/hack-attack-burn-almost-any-video-file-to-a-playable-dvd-232322.php">Burning almost any video file to a playable DVD</a> using <a href="http://dvdflick.sourceforge.net/">DVD Flick</a>.</p> <p>I was fascinated by <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ffmpeg/">ffmpeg</a> when I first read about it a couple of weeks ago. DVD Flick&nbsp;combines this along with other open source tool to create a nice, easy to use package.</p>
