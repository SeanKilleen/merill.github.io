            THERE comes a time when one senses the approach of a turning point, and catastrophe
            is but a few ticks of history away.

            That moment appears to be fast approaching in Sri Lanka. This small country is in
            fact as geopolitically significant to the United States and the West as troubled Cyprus
            and the other flaming sunspots that attract Western political and media attention.

            snap elections (four years ahead of schedule) in order, it is suspected, to stack
            the Cabinet with cronies and coalition allies in her effort to defenestrate Prime
            Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, a relative moderate on the Tamil issue. [<a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/commentary/story/0,4386,234590,00.html">Read
