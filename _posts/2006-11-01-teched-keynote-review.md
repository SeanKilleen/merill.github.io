<p>My thoughts on the keynote that was presented at Tech.Ed Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>To start off with the keynote was way too long and went on for what felt like four hours. I expected the presenters to excite the large gathering of developers about the new innovations that will be comnig in the .NET platform. Instead the damn PeopleReady message was stuffed down our throats. Repeatedly.</p>
<p>What do I care about some marketing initiative bs from Microsoft? Is this the sign of things to come with SteveB taking over the reins? I sure hope not.</p>
<p>The demos by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/the_hardman">Matty</a> on the other hand were a treat to watch.</p>
