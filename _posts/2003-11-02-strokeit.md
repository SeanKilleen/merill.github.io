            This is a must have utility on all Windows machines. &#160;<a href="http://www.tcbmi.com/strokeit/">StrokeIt</a> is
            a mouse gesture recognition program. Once you install the program simply right click
            and make gestures with your mouse to perform actions. For example I never have to
            move my mouse to the corner of a window to minimize it, I just make a small mouse
            movement and presto the window minimizes.

            Some browse like Opera and Mozilla have mouse gestures built-in but Stroke It is truly
            unique in that it work on all windows. And the best thing I love is its small footprint
            (less than 200k). Stroke It is so cool almost everyone at my office uses StrokeIt.
