<p>Now isn&rsquo;t this the best news ever! <a href="http://www.shawnburke.com/">Shawn Burke</a> writes about <a href="http://www.shawnburke.com/default.aspx?document=185&amp;userinterface=9">plans to release the source code</a> for the Windows Forms (which is basically a .NET wrapper around Win32).</p>
<p>The goal is to make the source code and the PDBs available for debugging. Imagine that. Being able to step into the framework code, that&rsquo;s what I call awesome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a heavy user of <a href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/">Lutz Roeder&rsquo;s Reflector</a> but being able to step into the code would be heavenly!</p>
<p>Now, can we try the same for the ASP.NET code as well?</p>
<p>Also check out his follow up&nbsp;<a href="http://www.shawnburke.com/default.aspx?document=187">post</a>, man did he blast those nincompoops who claim that Microsoft&rsquo;s only security is &lsquo;security through obscurity&rsquo;!</p>
