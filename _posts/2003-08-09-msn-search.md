        Hey I just did a search on <a href="http://search.msn.com">MSN</a> and these guys
        are FAST now, as&#160;fast as Google! Will Microsoft really beat Google?
    </p>

        Anyway I did my favorite search on <a href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=merill+fernando&amp;FORM=SMCRT">merill
        fernando</a> and came out #1 and a search for <a href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=merill&amp;FORM=SMCRT">merill</a> is
        ranked at #20. Okay enough playing around, I need to get back to studying.
