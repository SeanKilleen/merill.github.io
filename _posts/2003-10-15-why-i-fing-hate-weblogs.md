        Statement of Audience<br />
        ---------------------<br />
        I realize that nothing I say matters to anyone else on the entire planet. 
        <br />
        My opinions are useless and unfocused.&#160; I am an expert in nothing.&#160; I know
        nothing.&#160; I am confused about almost everything. I cannot, as an individual,
        ever possibly know everything, or even enough to make editorial commentary on the
        vast vast majority of things that exist in my world.&#160; This is a stupid document;
        it is meaningless drivel that I do not expect any of the several billion people on
        my planet to actually read.&#160; People who do read my rambling, incoherent dumbfuckery
        are probably just as confused as I am, if not moreso, as they are looking to my sorry
        ass for an opinion when they should be outside playing Frisbee with their dog or screwing
        their life partner or getting a dog or getting a life partner.&#160; Anyone who actually
        takes the time to read my bullshit probably deserves to ingest my fucked up and obviously
        mistaken opinions on whatever it is that I have written about.
