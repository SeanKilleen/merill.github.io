I&#39;ve been using FireFox 3 beta 3 for quite some time and was pretty happy with it. Fired up FF today and was prompted with a nice upgrade button. They&#39;ve been doing some tweaking on the JavaScript engine and its made applications that I use quite often like GMail to work lightning fast.

From the FireFox Release Notes:
</p>
<p>
<em><span style="font-size: 80%; font-weight: bold">[Improved in Beta 4!]</span>
Speed: improvements to our JavaScript engine as well as profile guided
optimizations have resulted in significant improvements in performance.
Compared to Firefox 2, web applications like Google Mail and Zoho Office
run twice as fast in Firefox&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;4</em>.
