        One down four more to go! The real exam was much tougher than the Transcender practise
        questions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The questions were evenly distributed and some of the areas that I got caught was
        in the Security (What the heck was that&#160;PrincipalPermission class?). The Data
        access questions were not too bad and pretty much everything was covered in the ADO.NET
        course.

        Next exam: Windows Applications.
