<p><em>I was recently reminded of a story one of our development managers told me.&nbsp; Before he started his career in software he was a sailor aboard a Russian sub.&nbsp; Inspections by the admiral were a regular occurrence and involved a huge investment of time to clean the entire sub&hellip; As you might expect Russian admirals were fairly demanding and always expected to find problems.&nbsp; In fact they kept looking until they found the problem however unimportant they were.&nbsp; Apparently the sailors came up with a creative way address placate the admiral.&nbsp; They would leave one, fairly obvious, pipe un-cleaned. The admiral would find this pipe, insist that it be cleaned and feel satisfied that he found a problem and not dig any deeper.&nbsp; This practice became known as using &ldquo;the Admiral&rsquo;s pipe&rdquo;.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>I will leave it to you to apply this to your work with your own management whether a Russian admiral or IT manager&hellip;&nbsp; <br /></em></p>
