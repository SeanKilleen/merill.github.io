<p>I was able find a power socket at the end of the room where I was able to get 
my notebook charged again and guess what Dr. Ruwan from the Colombo University 
too was running around trying to get his notebook charged too.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister who was supposed to be the Chief Guest was a no show due 
to his presidential campaign (and don't let me get started on yesterdays fiasco 
where all the roads were blocked, it took me fours hours to get home!) instead 
Prof. Tissa Witharana the Minister of Science and Technology turned up and read 
out from a scripted note. The other speakers included Prof. Samaranayake and 
Manju Hathotuwa of the <a href="http://www.icta.lk">ICT Agency</a> who spoke 
about what ICTA is doing to take ICT to the masses. I must say that I'm pretty 
impressed with how far reaching these were.</p>
<p>After a tea break the CXO conference&nbsp;kicked off with <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0111930/">Dr. Sanjiva</a>'s Welcome 
Note&nbsp;where he gave an introduction to FOSS and what it was all about. Dr. 
Sanjiva though iterated the fact that Free software does not mean free as in 
'Free of Cost'. </p>
<p>I'm right now listening to the Manager of the Open Source Lab from IBM, India 
who's going into detail on all the open source projects that IBM has been 
contributing to.</p>
