Tim Bray from Sun Microsystems posts ten reasons why blogging is good for your career.
<ol>
 	<li>You have to get noticed to get promoted.</li>
 	<li>You have to get noticed to get hired.</li>
 	<li>It really impresses people when you say “Oh, I’ve written about that, just google for XXX and I’m on the top page” or “Oh, just google my name.”</li>
 	<li>No matter how great you are, your career depends on communicating. The way to get better at anything, including communication, is by practicing. Blogging is good practice.</li>
 	<li>Bloggers are better-informed than non-bloggers. Knowing more is a career advantage.</li>
 	<li>Knowing more also means you’re more likely to hear about interesting jobs coming open.</li>
 	<li>Networking is good for your career. Blogging is a good way to meet people.</li>
 	<li>If you’re an engineer, blogging puts you in intimate contact with a worse-is-better 80/20 success story. Understanding this mode of technology adoption can only help you.</li>
 	<li>If you’re in marketing, you’ll need to understand how its rules are changing as a result of the current whirlwind, which nobody does, but bloggers are at least somewhat less baffled.</li>
 	<li>It’s a lot harder to fire someone who has a public voice, because it will be noticed.</li>
</ol>
