        Microsoft is slowly breaking into the phone market. Motorola has just <a href="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1105_2-5053475.html">announced</a> that
        they would be creating phones running Microsoft Smart-phone software.
    </p>
    <p>
        I can't wait for the day when smart-phones will be available for less than Rs. 10k/-
        ($ 100/-)
