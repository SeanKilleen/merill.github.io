<p>Well I never thought I would say this but I&rsquo;ve just bid goodbye to <a href="http://www.rssbandit.org/">RssBandit</a>&nbsp;my feedreader for the last three years and completely switched over to <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a>.</p>
<p>The deciding factor was that I could read all my feeds from home. Google Reader is way fast over dial-up than RssBandit simply because the heavy lifting is done on the server.</p>
<p>If I had better bandwidth, would I have switched? I think it&rsquo;s time someone wroteup a serious <a href="http://wpf.netfx3.com/">WPF</a> XBAP that does feed reading. I&rsquo;m betting on Newsgator to do this. Wait, that&rsquo;s a super cool project to work on&hellip;</p>
