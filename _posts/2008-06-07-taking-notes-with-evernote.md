<p>For a long time I've been searching for the ultimate note taking application. OneNote used to be my favorite but since I became a consultant and needed to move between different workstations it became a strain to keep things in sync.</p> <p>The ideal note taking application needs to meet the following criteria for me:</p> <p>- Web Access: I should be able to take notes in a hurry without having to install any applications.</p> <p>- Desktop Application: Should be easy to use and needs to be as good as OneNote.</p> <p>- Synchronisation: The desktop should be able to sync to the web so that I have the latest version both online and offline.</p> <p>- Secure: Google has spoilt me with their https support for all the Google Apps that I use. I hate to have my personal stuff sent over plain text for anyone on the network to view.</p> <p>For a long time I've been using Google Docs for storing stuff, unfortunately that doesn't include desktop support.</p> <p><a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a> is the closest that has come to the nirvana I've been searching for. The two coolest features for me are the desktop application and the online synchronisation feature. The best part is that it's free!</p>
