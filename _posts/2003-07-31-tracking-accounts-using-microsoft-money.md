    <p>
        I've started using Microsoft Money to keep track of all my accounts. This is a really
        powerful tool that every professional must have in order to be better able to manage
        their income.

    <p>
        You could either use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/money">Microsoft Money</a> or <a href="http://www.quicken.com">Quicken</a> to
        track your personal accounts, feature-wise both of them seem to be exactly the same
        so I chose Money since it's from Microsoft (easier learning curve and excellent Help)
        and I also have the registered version for PocketPC that came with my iPaq.
