It's been a long time since my last post and I being kept away from
regular blogging due to a number of things. Between the hectic work at
office and some of my other commitments which includes searching for a
new home in Colombo, I've been sort of drowning and grasping for breath
in the last couple of months. <br>
<br>
To add to this I downloaded and installed Vista the day it was
released. Would you believe it that I have had no problems with any of
my applications with the exception of BlogJet. This limited me to
posting from the dasBlog web interface which is not really my ideal
client for blogging.
