<p>This is wicked cool! Check out google code search to find out how various commands are being used by developers. </p>
<p>Say you want to figure out how to use the File.ReadAllText method from C#, it&rsquo;s as simple as typing <font face="Courier New" size="2">lang:C# File.ReadAllText</font> and this is what you <a href="http://google.com/codesearch?q=lang%3AC%23+File.ReadAllText&amp;btnG=Search+Code">get</a>. For VB use <font face="Courier New" size="2">lang:basic File.ReadAllText</font> </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s cool is that it even looks up code&nbsp;inside zip files. Wait, it gets better, drill-down into a hit and&nbsp;you see a list of all the&nbsp;other code files in that zip/project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No more downloading code samples to figure out how a command is being. To keep things clear the license under which the code is published is displayed as part of the result.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been living on Live search for the past four weeks, but I&rsquo;ll definitely be relying on Google for code search.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://google.com/codesearch/advanced_code_search">Advanced Search</a> to figure out what the options are.</p>
<p>One feature that should be added though would be color coding. I&rsquo;m sure it must be in the works though.</p>
