        Okay folks here are the downloads to the <a href="http://gateway.lk/sifweb/merilldownloads/030911Presentation.zip">presentation</a> (2.7MB)
        and the <a href="http://gateway.lk/sifweb/merilldownloads/030911Code.zip">code samples</a> (120KB)
        that I promised at yesterday's seminar. You can also download the same stuff directly
        from <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/UserSamples/Details.aspx?SampleGuid=61dc2e6d-faad-4aea-b18c-abcb7a4c9260">GDN</a>. 
    </p>

        It was great to see so many people interested in .NET and I have already got some
        really excellent feedback by mail. There was just one hitch during presentation when
        I wasn't able to demo the data access code due to a SQL Server issue. Apparently Windows
        Server 2003 <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;329329">only
        supports</a> SQL Server 2000 Service Pack 3 and above. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyway I would love to hear more feedback from everyone who came for the seminar including
        the shortcomings so that I can improve on the next one. You can mail me at <a href="mailto:mail@merill.net">mail@merill.net</a> or

        The next seminar will be on migrating applications from Visual Basic 6/COM to Visual
        Basic .NET at 5.30pm on the 15th of September.

    <p>
        The next course that I will be starting at Gateway on 20 Sep (Sat) will be on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/traincert/syllabi/2373bfinal.asp">Programming
        with Microsoft Visual Basic .NET</a>, you can even download the first two modules
        in the course from the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/traincert/syllabi/2373bfinal.asp">course
        page</a> at Microsoft.

        Update: It looks like my hosting provider doesn't let me keep zip files for downloading,
        I will try to put up the files in another location and let you know once the url is
        fixed.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Update: The links to the presentation and code files are working now.
