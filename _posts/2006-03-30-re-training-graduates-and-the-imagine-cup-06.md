<p>Towards the end of last&nbsp;year I was involved in training a batch&nbsp;of non-IT&nbsp;graduates on .NET. The specific program was a pilot project with Moratuwa University funded by USAID where the goal was to pick a group of deserving graduates who were un-employed and skill them up to be employable in the IT field.</p>
<p>My joy was to see the students so taken up with .NET that most of them chose to do their final project on .NET and I&rsquo;m happy to note that all those who completed the program are now employed [<a href="http://vanguard1.vanguardlk.com/lbo/fullstory.php?newsID=1180315546&amp;no_view=1&amp;SEARCH_TERM=5">LBO</a>]. Unfortunately I couldn&rsquo;t attend the graduation ceremony last evening as I was held up with the Imagine Cup judging.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Imagine Cup, last evening&nbsp;we had a tough time picking the top five finalists for the national round given the wealth of innovative ideas and solutions from among the 40 odd proposals that came in. Over 200 undergrads from a number of local universites took part, I was happy&nbsp;to see entries coming in from Ruhuna and Wayamba as well.&nbsp;The teams should be announced shortly so keep an eye out for an email from Jina.</p>
