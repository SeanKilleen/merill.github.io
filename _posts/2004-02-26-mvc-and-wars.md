            MVC apparently is way too simple ;-)
        </p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
            <span style=''>Now we have "<a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2004/01/27/wars.html" title="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2004/01/27/wars.html">WARS</a>"
            - Worflow, Action, Representation, and State. The implementation example described&#160;by <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/au/81" title="http://today.java.net/pub/au/81">Rupp</a> is
            pretty simple, which I like. The notion that presentation can be ignored, and boiled
            down to a detail of "representation" I find to be a little extreme (of course!), but
            overall this seems like a somewhat sane model.</span>

            <span style=''>That said, still not sure how many people would "get" this model -
            but if you are into MVC, WARS might be a reasonable alternative... [link from <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.jsp?thread_id=23625" title="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.jsp?thread_id=23625">TheServerSide</a>]</span>
