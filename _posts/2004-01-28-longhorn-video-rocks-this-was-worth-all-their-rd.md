            This video really shows how clever the R&amp;D for Longhorn was and why some of the
            more unusual capabilities (like the DirectX Magnifying vector tool) actually enable
            everyday apps to be amazing.

            While Microsoft is making some mistakes in the community (and with licensing terms
            and security and MVPs) the quality of this demo app really demonstrates that Longhorn
            apps are truly way ahead of what I see on the bridge/vid screens of StarTrek.

            I really get goosebumps when I watch this video and a careful study of the app and
            watching the video more than once reveals many capabilities that are not obvious at
            first glance which are quite profound about the native capabilities:
