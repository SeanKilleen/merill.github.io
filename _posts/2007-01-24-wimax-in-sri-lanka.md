<p>This is wicked cool. Dialog has started pilot testing WiMAX with data speeds of 10MBPS. They&nbsp;areas being tested right now are Hambantota, Matara, Galle, Kurunagala, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa.</p>
<p>If the rates are reasonable this is going to be a landmark event for Sri Lanka when launched. [<a href="http://www.lbo.lk/fullstory.php?newsID=470128768&amp;no_view=1&amp;SEARCH_TERM=5">Source: LBO</a>]</p>
