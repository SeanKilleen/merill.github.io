<P>I love the Vista unzip dialog. Just two steps to unzip a file. Although XP first added the unzip to Windows, it was crudely done. It always went through the wizard which had three pages to add to the misery the check setting to ‘Show extracted files’ never remembered its previous state.</P>

<P>[UPDATE] I've been getting quite a lot of hits from Google with people searching on "How to unzip files in Vista". You basically need just two steps.</P>
<P>1. Right click on the zip file.</P>
<P>2. Click on 'Extract All...' to get the dialog box shown above.</P>
<P>3. That's all!</P>
