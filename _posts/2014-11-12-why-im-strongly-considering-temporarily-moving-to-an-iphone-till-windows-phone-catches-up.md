Why I'm strongly considering temporarily moving to an iPhone till Windows Phone catches up:
Just got an email that my work phone has been moved to Jabber. Cisco says Jabber can be used from any device, they have iOS and Android apps but nothing for Windows Phone. Long story short the fault lies with Windows Phone.

This was posted in the forum last month by a Cisco rep: 'Hi Brian,
The open sockets we need to have running in the background are currently not supported by Windows Phone 8.1. The Windows Phone development group has been discussing with us to ensure that they can support Jabber architecture in the Threshold release.'

The Xbox Music app is the bane of my existence. I am an Xbox music subscriber and it is absolutely pathetic for a native app. This article (dated yesterday) and the comments thread sums it all up. http://wmpoweruser.com/xbox-music-still-sucks-and-thats-a-sh…

And then you see benchmarks like this <a href="http://wmpoweruser.com/xbox-music-still-sucks-and-thats-a-shame/">http://www.anandtech.com/show/8666/the-apple-ipad-air-2-revi…</a> (also <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-tablet-turning-point/">http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-tablet-turning-point/</a>) with the iPhone 6 &amp; iPad Air beating out all other devices, providing a superior app store selection.

Even the new the Microsoft Office app that Microsoft released for iOS is much better at rendering and more feature rich than the native Office apps in Windows Phone (which have been native and haven't been update since WP 7,0).
