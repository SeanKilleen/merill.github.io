<P>With dasBlog 1.9 being released <A href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DasBlog19Released.aspx">today</A> I made a quick jump and got the site upgraded to the latest version. I also joined the dasBlog mailing list to see if I could make some type of contribution back to the community.</P>
<P>Plus, I finally moved away from the default dasBlog theme and switched over to <A href="http://www.madskristensen.dk/blog/">Mads Kristensen</A>'s clean and simple theme.</P>
<P>In the process of upgrading the site I got a chance to use Scooter Software's <A href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/">Beyond Compare</A>, which I must say is a truly awesome work of art and a must have for anyone who works with a site hosted on FTP. If only I had known about this when doing my painful dasBlog upgrades in the past.</P>
