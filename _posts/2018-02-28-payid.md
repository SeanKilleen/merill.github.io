Have you tried PayID yet? Given that you can only have one PayID identifier for each account and bank it doesn’t seem to make much sense to use your telephone number. Instead I’ve opted to use bankname@myemail.net (eg nab@myemail.net) thanks to the domain catch all feature in Google Apps. With gmail you could use the + alias (eg. nab+merill@gmail.com) or use the Outlook Alias feature where you can have multiple email addresses mapped to each account.
Thanks to PayID I can now keep all of my income in the offset account and only transfer to my checking account at the very last minute. I tried transferring from my NAB account to ING and it come through even before I could switch between the two banking apps.
Looking forward to shaving a few years off my mortgage.
What approach have you come up with for PayID?
