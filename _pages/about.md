I'm a Product Manager in the Azure AD (Identity) team at Microsoft. I focus on Azure AD extensibility which includes the Identity side of Graph API and Graph PowerShell. I also help some of our largest Azure AD customers in Australia get the most out of Azure Active Directory and related Identity technologies from Microsoft.
